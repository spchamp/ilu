"reference" tests the passing of aliased reference types by building a
diamond-linked data structure on the client, passing it to the server
and back, and inspecting the returned result to see if it's still
diamond-linked.  If so, it exits with a status of 0.  If not, it
prints the structure of the returned data, and exits with status of 1.

To build:

	% ilumkmf
	% make

Running the C server looks like this:

% ./server &
[1]
ilusbh:13.1.101.26.2609.369eb3a5.0/----;ilut%3Am-DkhjdxzArh5mFFIV5HUba3abN;iiop@tcp_13.1.101.26_38333
%

The client is invoked with the SBH from the server as an argument:

% ./client 'ilusbh:13.1.101.26.2609.369eb3a5.0/----;ilut%3Am-DkhjdxzArh5mFFIV5HUba3abN;iiop@tcp_13.1.101.26_38333'
%
