This file describes how to use the tcl scripts in this directory
to run a canned regression test.

The top-level script testreg.tcl sets some necessary variables
and establishes the log and bindingdir files for the test in the /tmp
directory (this selection can be easily changed by modifying testreg.tcl).

testreg.tcl then continues by running the test described in the README
file in this directory, using single and then multiple repeats of the
client, and then an explicit specification of IOR by the client.
The progress of the test is reported online.  When the test is successful,
the logs are removed. 

To use the script, type the sequence:
    ilumkmf
    make
    make test
