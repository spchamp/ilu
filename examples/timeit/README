"timeit" performs timing tests between a server and a client, both
implemented in ANSI C.  The client performs 6 tests, a cardinal ping
("cardinal"), a real ping ("real"), a 10-char string ping ("string")
(where ping means sending a value and receiving that value back
again), a simulated document fetch ("doctest"), a oneway push of 8000
double-precision floating point values ("imgtest"), and a oneway push
of a sequence of a record type ("rectest").  The "-hostname HOSTNAME"
switch can be used on the client to direct it to a server running on
a different machine; the "-p PROTOCOL" and "-t TRANSPORT STACK"
switches can be used on the server to direct it to use a particular
transport and protocol.

To build and run, use the following commands:

% ilumkmf
% make timeit-server timeit-client

% ./timeit-server -p sunrpc
