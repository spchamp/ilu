"relocate" is a skeleton of a simple implementation repository, implemented
in Python.  It tests the kernel relocate functionality.  We start a "manager",
which listens to requests from clients and starts servers as those requests
come in, then run a "client" against it, which causes the "manager" program
to start a copy of the "sprogram" service program.

Type "make ptest" to test this.
