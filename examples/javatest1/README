1.  Make sure the "java" interpreter is on your PATH, and that
"$(ILUHOME)/bin" is on your path.  If you use the literal expression
"$(ILUHOME)/bin", make sure that the environment variable ILUHOME
is properly defined.

2.  Make sure "./classes" and "$(ILUHOME)/lib/javaclasses" are on
your CLASSPATH.
(or better: use the -classpath commandline arguments; make sure $ILUHOME
and $JAVAHOME is defined)

3.  Make sure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH has "$(ILUHOME)/lib" on it.

4.  Run "ilumkmf" to create the Makefile.

5.  Run "make" to generate and compile the Java stubs.

6.  Run the server:

    % java -classpath ./classes:$ILUHOME/lib/ilu.jar:$JAVAHOME/lib/classes.zip xerox.ilu.test1.Test server &
    [1] 5410
    % < Test start...
    < iluClass built
    < server side init
    < server created
    < trueOb created
    < trueOb registered; sbh: ilu:server-for-test-1/test-object-1;ilu%3Aghxmwu1rVZWI9ztJ7udY86rYiR3;sunrpc_2_0x61a79_2544659852@sunrpcrm=tcp_13.1.101.26_53337
    < sleep and serve requests

    % 

7.  Run the client:

    % java -classpath ./classes:$ILUHOME/lib/ilu.jar:$JAVAHOME/lib/classes.zip xerox.ilu.test1.Test client
    < Test start...
    < iluClass built
    < client side
    < got remote object ilu_stubs.Simple.TestObject_Stub@ee7011b0
    < before calling method1
    < method1 called: arg = 7
    < will return: ac = 7
    < method returned: 7
    < before calling method1
    < method1 called: arg = 7
    < will return: ac = 14
    < method returned: 14
    < before calling method1 exception case
    < method1 called: arg = -1
    < will throw Exc1
    < caught excpected exception ilu_stubs.Simple.Exc1: ilu.UserException
    < returned; did it raise the exception? 
    < done
    < bye bye
    % 

8.  Remember to kill the server process after you're finished with it.
