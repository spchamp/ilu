Instructions for testing Simple.isl with Test.java
**************************************************

Make sure you have a "classes" subdirectory.
	Not necessary anymore if you use make

Make sure you have a "ilustubs" subdirectory.

Enable these programs if needed
enable java
enable gdb-4.15

Set these environments variables

	Make the native java-ilu library accessible
	It currently is in ../../runtime/java
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ../../runtime/java

	Make the java java-ilu library accessible
	classes are in ../../runtime/java/javaclasses
setenv CLASSPATH ./classes:../../runtime/java/javaclasses:/project/java/jdk-1.0.2/lib/classes.zip


Generate the stubs
	Not necessary if you use make; as the make file would do that
../../stubbers/java/java-stubber Simple.isl


Compile all the java stubs
	Not necessary if you use make; as the make file would do that
javac -d classes javastubs/Simple/*java

Compile your java test program
	Not necessary anymore; the make file will do that
javac -d classes Test.java


Run the server side before running the client side;
Run the server side bare:
java xerox.ilu.test1.Test server
java -Dilu.debug.init=4 -Dilu.debug.default=4 xerox.ilu.test1.Test server


Run the client side bare
java xerox.ilu.test1.Test client



If you want Ilu debug output
setenv ILU_DEBUG MOST



Run the server side with gdb and trace logs enabled
	The -D flag introduces debugging parameters
dbx /project/java/jdk-1.0.2/bin/sparc/java
ignore POLL
run -Dilu.debug.default=4 xerox.ilu.test1.Test server 

java -Dilu.debug.default=4 xerox.ilu.test1.Test server


Run the client side with gdb
gdb /project/java/jdk-1.0.2/bin/sparc/java
run xerox.ilu.test1.Test client
