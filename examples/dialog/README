This simple example pauses for user input everywhere the application gets control.  By deliberately breaking network connectivity at one of these pauses, one can test ILU's reaction to network failures.  The example is available only in C.

To build,

% ilumkmf
% make

To run the server,

% ./server
SBH = 'ilu:DialogTest-Server/it;ilu%3Dp4NgL1yu-oubkE2nAEl9rLUU6iU;sunrpc_2_0x31000400_2621784198@sunrpcrm=tcp_13.2.116.14_4307'

The full syntax for the server is this:

server [-pt <pinfo> <transport layer>...] ... [-p pinfo] [-t <transport layer>...]

The -p and -t switches affect the RPC protocol and transport stack used in the last port created for the server; each use of the -pt switch causes an additional port to be created.


Then run the client

% ./client 'ilu:DialogTest-Server/it;ilu%3Dp4NgL1yu-oubkE2nAEl9rLUU6iU;sunrpc_2_0x31000400_2621784198@sunrpcrm=tcp_13.2.116.14_4307'

passing the host address and port number from the SBH printed by the server.
