This very simple example is used to demonstrate ILU's CORBA 2 C++
stubber and runtime.

To build:

On Unix machines:

  % ilumkmf
  % make fooserver fooclient

On Windows machines:

  cppstubber2 foo.isl
  nmake -f iluwin32.mak CFG="Win32 Debug"

To exercise the example:

1.  Start a server:

  % ./fooserver &
  Exported ilu:watson.parc.xerox.com.fooserver/foo_instance_0;ilu%3Ahv3NXCfUZAED1fzGfUwMIrs11Dd;sunrpc_2_0x61a79_1521219199@sunrpcrm=tcp_13.1.101.26_58135
  [1] 22510
  % 

2.  Client usage is fooclient [inarg [ HOSTNAME ]]
	where	inarg - (defaults to 0) argument to send to bar method - if 1, bar raises exception
		HOSTNAME - used as part of the id for the server - defaults to this host

  % ./fooclient
  looking up object foo_instance_0 at server watson.parc.xerox.com.fooserver
  foo_bar_impl::zap entered
  inarg = 0, inoutarg  = 0xaa
  zap returned True, inoutarg 0x55, outarg 3.14159
