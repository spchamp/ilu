"w3mux" contains a simple test of the w3mux transport functionality.
The server exports an object which squares numbers sent to it.
The client exports the same object.  The client connects to the
server, squares a few numbers, then sends ``itself'' to the server,
to test the callback transport mechanism in w3mux.  The server then
squares a number using the client.  There is no output unless things
go wrong, but it's interesting to set ILU_DEBUG to "call:packet:w3mux"
and watch the debugging messages.

To build and run, use the following commands:

% ilumkmf
% make server client

% ./server &
[1]
exported ilu:w3muxtest.1.watson.parc.xerox.com/0;ilu%3AoAIRNReC24FHCanUU4YtQPEZzoo;sunrpc@w3mux_7=tcp_13.1.101.26_50046
% ./client
% ./client
%

You can specify "-threads" to either the client or the server to use
the threaded implementation of w3mux instead of the event-driven one.
You can specify any protocol to the server with "-p", and any transport
with "-t".

There's also a "-v" switch on the server to tell it to output a line
every ping1 call.
