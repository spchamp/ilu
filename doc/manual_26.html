<TITLE>ILU Reference Manual - Algorithm for Generation of Structural-Hash Type IDs</TITLE>

<H1><A NAME="SEC659" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC659">Algorithm for Generation of Structural-Hash Type IDs</A></H1>
<P>
The following type ID construction algorithm is used for automatic generation of type IDs
for all types and exceptions in ILU that have no explicitly specified type ID.  The type ID
is formed by (1) constructing a string
containing all the salient information about the type or exception, in a
standardized form, (2) taking the NIST Secure Hash Signature of that
string, and (3) rendering the SHS in a string form as a 27-digit base-64
number.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC660" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC660">Resolving Type Ambiguities</A></H2>
<P>
There are some types that can be described in multiple ways, using more or less generalized constructions.  For example, the primitive integer types could also be described as fixed-point constructions.  Every type that can be described multiple ways is always considered to <EM>be</EM> the one that uses the least general constructs.  In particular, the primitive integer types are indeed considered primitive -- not fixed-point constructions.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC661" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC661">Constructing the "salient information string"</A></H2>
<P>
This string consists of 8-bit bytes.
Many of those bytes are described here using characters, which are taken to be in the US-ASCII character code.
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;info string&#62; ::= &#60;self ref&#62; &#60;defn&#62;*
&#60;self ref&#62; ::= &#60;typeref&#62; | &#60;exnref&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
The salient information string consists of a reference to the <EM>initial item</EM>
(the type or exception being characterized),
followed by the definitions of the interfaces, execeptions,
and non-primitive non-explicitly-IDed types referenced directly or indirectly by the initial item.
Each interface, exception, and non-primitive non-explicitly-IDed type that
is referenced in the type string is defined exactly once in the type
string, and these are the only definitions that appear in the type
string.  In particular, the string includes no definition of any primitive type,
nor of any type whose ID is explicitly specified in the source language
(explicit IDs can optionally be given in ISL by appending a <CODE>TYPEID</CODE> clause to a type definition;
in OMG IDL there is a defined ID for every named type).
The definitions appear in the order of first appearance of
the corresponding reference.  In other words, the definitions appear in breadth-first order.  In particular, if the initial item has a definition
(note that primitive types do not), then it is the first definition.
Every definition of an item is preceded by at least one reference to that item.
This forbids adding definitions of types in irrelevant cycles.
<P>
We could compress this a bit by making each definition immediately
follow, and thus not duplicate, its first reference.  But this gains
little, and type fingerprints are not computed at runtime anyway.  And
it has this cost: it tempts an implementor to use a recursive strategy
for generating the type string, and a recursive implementation will
crash with a stack overflow when presented with hostile interface
source code.  The structure given is amenable to a simple
worklist-based generation strategy.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC662" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC662">References to Types, Interfaces, and Exceptions</A></H2>
<P>
A type reference is a reference to either a primitive type or a
constructed one, or an explicit type UID (if the type UID has been
explicitly specified).
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;typeref&#62; ::= &#60;primitive&#62; | &#60;typeciteref&#62; | &#60;typeidref&#62;
&#60;typeciteref&#62; ::= "(ref" &#60;sp&#62; &#60;type cite&#62; ")"
&#60;typeidref&#62; ::= "(id" &#60;sp&#62; &#60;UID string&#62; ")"
&#60;UID string&#62; ::= &#60;string&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
The primitive types are:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;primitive&#62; ::=
	  "byte"
	| "shortcardinal"
	| "cardinal"
	| "longcardinal"
	| "shortinteger"
	| "integer"
	| "longinteger"
	| "shortreal"
	| "real"
	| "longreal"
	| "shortcharacter"
	| "character"
	| "longcharacter"
	| "boolean"
	| "pickle"
	| "void"
</PRE>
<P>
A reference to a constructed type cites two things: (1) the name of
the interface in which the type is defined, and (2) the name given
that type.  These are ultimately &#60;id&#62;s, as defined in ISL;
ISL identifiers may not contain any characters (e.g., quotes, parentheses)
that are treated specially in the syntax of salient information strings.  In a salient information string, &#60;id&#62;s are represented in US-ASCII (with no leading length nor trailing null).
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;type cite&#62; ::= &#60;ifc ref&#62; &#60;sp&#62; &#60;typename&#62;
&#60;ifc ref&#62; ::= &#60;interfacename&#62;
&#60;interfacename&#62; ::= &#60;id&#62;
&#60;typename&#62; ::= &#60;id&#62;
&#60;sp&#62; ::= a single space character (i.e., code 32(decimal))
</PRE>
<P>
Exception references similarly have two forms, depending on whether an ID has been explicitly specified:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;exnref&#62; ::= "(exn" &#60;sp&#62; ( &#60;exnciteref&#62; | &#60;exnidref&#62; ) ")"

&#60;exn cite&#62; ::= &#60;ifc ref&#62; &#60;sp&#62; &#60;exnname&#62;
&#60;exnname&#62; ::= &#60;id&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC663" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC663">Definitions of Types, Interfaces, and Exceptions</A></H2>
<P>
There are three kinds of things that need to be defined: types,
interfaces, and exceptions.
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;defn&#62; ::= &#60;type def&#62; | &#60;ifc def&#62; | &#60;exn def&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC664" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC664">Types</A></H3>
<P>
A definition of a type gives its compound name, brand, and what the type
is defined to be.
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;type def&#62; ::= "(type" &#60;sp&#62; &#60;type cite&#62; &#60;sp&#62; &#60;brand&#62; &#60;sp&#62; &#60;type desc&#62; ")"

<P>
A type can be defined either to be a primitive or a construction.
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;type desc&#62; ::= &#60;primitive&#62; | &#60;construction&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
Constructed types have different forms, specific to their types.

<H4><A NAME="SEC665" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC665">Alias Types</A></H4>
<P>
For alias types that have an explicitly assigned type ID, we simply
generate a &#60;typeidref&#62; when it's referenced.  For alias types that have
the same type ID as their base type, we just use the base type in its place when
constructing type info strings.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC666" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC666">Array Types</A></H4>
<P>
This should be mostly obvious.  An integer is given as its shortest decimal representation; positive integers have no sign character.

</PRE>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC667" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC667">Record Types</A></H4>
<P>
The field names are included on the grounds that they give clues to
the semantics of the type, so different field names make different
types.
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;record&#62; ::= "(record" (&#60;sp&#62; &#60;rfield&#62;)+ ")"

</PRE>
<P>
The &#60;typeref&#62; at the top level of a UNION constructor is the type of
the tag, which must be an integer type, a character type, an
enumerated type, or boolean.
The &#60;discvalue&#62; is an integer when the tag is a numeric type,
a string when the tag is an enumerated or character type,

The definition of an exception gives its compound name, its brand, and the

A &#60;string&#62; is encoded using US-ASCII and surrounded with double-quotes (US-ASCII code 34).
If the double-quote character appears in the string,
it is escaped with a leading backslash character.  If a backslash character appears in the string,
it is escaped with an additional leading backslash character.  If a non-printing character
(with a US-ASCII code less than 32(decimal) or greater than 126(decimal)) appears in the string,
it appears as a 3-digit octal number containing the US-ASCII code for that character, preceded with a backslash character.

Abstract:<BR>
"This standard specifies a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) which can be used to generate a condensed
representation of a message called a message digest. The SHA-1 is required for use with the Digital
Signature Algorithm (DSA) as specified in the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and whenever a secure hash
algorithm is required for Federal applications. The SHA-1 is used by both the transmitter and intended

<P>
The SHS is converted to a string of length 32 bytes, each
containing an ASCII character code.  First, two 0 bits are appended to
the 160-bit SHS.  This 162-bit string is encoded as 27 6-bit digits,
most significant digit first.  The encoding uses characters 'a' - 'z'
to represent the values 0-25, the characters 'A' - 'Z' to represent
the characters 26-51, the characters '0' - '9' to represent the values
52-61, the character '-' to represent the value 62, and the character
'+' to represent the value 63.  Finally the 5 bytes "ilut:" are
prepended, giving the total of 32 bytes.
