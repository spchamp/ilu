<H1><A NAME="SEC618" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC618">The TIM Documentation Language</A></H1>
<P>
This document describes the TIM documentation language that the documentation for
ILU is written in.  It is not necessary to be familiar with TIM to
use ILU; you will only need to know TIM if you wish to use it to
write or modify documentation.
<P>
TIM is essentially a superset of the GNU texinfo language,
version 2.
It adds several features such as support for pictures and URLs, but its most important extension is to provide
domain-specific markup commands to allow adding arbitrary meta-information to
Texinfo documents.  You should be familiar with the basic
Texinfo system first.  Documentation on Texinfo is supplied
with the ILU distribution; you should be able to find it in the files
<TT>`ILUSRC/doc/texinfo2.ps'</TT>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC619" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC619">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
Both TIM and Texinfo input files contain text `marked up' with document
markup commands.  These commands are similar to LaTeX commands, except that they
start with an at-sign character rather than a backslash.  They 
contain  meta-information about the area of the text to which they apply.
For example:
<PRE>
  A kernel server @dfn{export}s its objects by making them available
  to other modules.  It may do so via one or more @dfn{port}s, which are
  abstractly a tuple of (@metavar{rpc protocol}, @metavar{transport type},
  @metavar{transport address}).  For example, a typical port might
  provide access to a kernel server's objects via @code{(@protocol{Sun RPC},
  @transport{TCP/IP}, UNIX port 2076)}.  Another port on the
  same kernel server might provide access to the objects via
  @code{(@protocol{Xerox Courier}, @transport{XNS SPP}, XNS port 1394)}.
</PRE>
When formatted, this paragraph would look like
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A kernel server <I>export</I>s its objects by making them available
to other modules.  It may do so via one or more <I>port</I>s, which are
abstractly a tuple of (<VAR>rpc protocol</VAR>, <VAR>transport type</VAR>,
<VAR>transport address</VAR>).  For example, a typical port might
provide access to a kernel server's objects
via <CODE>(<CODE>Sun RPC</CODE>, <CODE>TCP/IP</CODE>, UNIX port 2076)</CODE>.  Another port on the
same kernel server might provide access to the objects via
<CODE>(<CODE>Xerox Courier</CODE>, <CODE>XNS SPP</CODE>, XNS port 1394)</CODE>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There are two
kinds of markup commands:  without arguments or with arguments.  The commands without
arguments always span some portion of the document, so we call them <I>span commands</I>.  They may be nested, but may not
overlap.  There are two forms of span commands, <I>style commands</I> and <I>format commands</I>.
The style commands mark some section of the text, typically a short sequence of text, with a
single attribute, which may be either a semantic tag like <CODE>important</CODE>, or a formatting style
like <CODE>italic</CODE>.  The format commands apply a similar tag to a block of the input; they begin
with a single line containing <CODE>@<VAR>attribute</VAR></CODE>, and end with a single line containing
<CODE>@end <VAR>attribute</VAR></CODE>.  Style commands may be nested in a block command, but block
commands should not be nested in style commands.
<P>
Markup commands with arguments always take a single line.  The line begins with <CODE>@<VAR>attribute</VAR></CODE>,
followed by whitespace, followed by the arguments, separated by whitespace.  If there is whitespace in
an argument, the argument is surrounded with braces, as in <BR>   <CODE>@deffun {struct foo} Bar ( arg )</CODE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC620" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC620">Extensions to GNU Texinfo</A></H2>
<P>
TIM removes the need to begin every file with <CODE>\input texinfo</CODE>,
and to end every file with <CODE>@bye</CODE>.  These lines are added automatically by
TIM as needed.  This allows a file to define both a stand-alone
document, and to be included as a section in some larger document.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC621" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC621">TIM Domain-Independent Format</A></H3>
<P>
TIM domain-independent format (<I>DIF</I>) is basically Texinfo with four new built-in commands.  They are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>@url</CODE>, a style command, is used to mark World Wide Web URL forms that appear
in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@picture</CODE>, a command with arguments, is used to include an Encapsulated Postscript picture
into the document.  It takes two arguments, the name of the file, and a caption for the picture.  The caption
may be omitted.
<LI>
<CODE>@ttitalic</CODE>, a style command, is used to indicate that this span should be rendered in an italic typewriter font, if available.
<LI>
<CODE>@timmacro</CODE>, a command with arguments, allows the user to define domain-specific markup commands.  The two arguments are the macro name, and the macro's replacement in vanilla DIF.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="SEC623" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC623">TIM Tools</A></H2>
<P>
ILU provides a program called <CODE>tim</CODE> to turn TIM files
into either PostScript, text, or GNU Info files.  It is
invoked as
<P>
<CODE>     tim <VAR>output-format</VAR> [ -s <VAR>flag</VAR> ] [ -m <VAR>macros</VAR> ] [ -o <VAR>output-file</VAR> ] [ <VAR>input-file</VAR>.tim ]</CODE>
<P>
where <VAR>output-format</VAR> must be either <B>-p</B> for Postscript output, <B>-i</B> for GNU Info output,
<B>-d</B> for TIM DIF output, <B>-t</B> for plain text output, 
and <B>-x</B> for vanilla GNU Texinfo output.
<P>
In addition, the switch <B>-v</B>
can be specified to cause the <CODE>tim</CODE> script to output information about
progress, the switch <B>-m <VAR>macro-file-name</VAR></B> may be specified to
have <CODE>tim</CODE> pre-load a file of <CODE>@timmacro</CODE> macros, the switch <B>-s</B> may
be specified to set various TexInfo conditional flags, and the switch
<B>-o <VAR>output-file-name</VAR></B> may used to specify the output file.  If no input
file is specified, <CODE>tim</CODE> reads from the standard input.  If no output file
is specified, <CODE>tim</CODE> writes to the standard output.
<P>
<CODE>tim</CODE> is a script written in the Python script language,
so you will need to have <CODE>Python</CODE> installed to use it.  See the
ILU installation instructions for a location from which <CODE>Python</CODE>
can be FTP'ed.  The script uses the GNU programs <CODE>texindex</CODE> and
<CODE>makeinfo</CODE>, along with <CODE>TeX</CODE> and <CODE>dvips</CODE>, so it is necessary
to have all four of those programs installed to use <CODE>tim</CODE>.
<P>
Another program called <CODE>timdif2html</CODE> can be used to turn TIM DIF
files into World Wide Web HTML.  See the end of the <CODE>timdif2html</CODE>
script for instructions on how to use it.  It in turn uses the script <CODE>eps2gif</CODE>,
which requires having <CODE>ghostscript</CODE> built with a GIF driver.  Both <CODE>timdif2html</CODE>
and <CODE>eps2gif</CODE> are Perl scripts, so the Perl interpreter <CODE>perl</CODE>
must be installed to use them.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC624" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC624">Markup Commands used with ILU</A></H2>
<P>
The file <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/doc/ilu-macros.tim'</TT> defines the following TIM markup commands
that are used with the ILU documentation:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>@var</CODE> is used to indicate a regular programming language variable.  The term <CODE>@metavar</CODE>
is used to mark meta-variables.
</UL>
<P>
TIM also extends texinfo by adding the following markup:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>@C</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the C language, e.g., <CODE>@C{#define}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@C++</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the C++ language, e.g., <CODE>@C++{#define}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@class</CODE> is used to mark names of object classes.
<LI>
<CODE>@command</CODE> is used to mark user input, such as a user-typed shell command, when it occurs
in the normal flow of text.  The term <CODE>@userinput</CODE> is used when the user input occurs
within a <CODE>@transcript</CODE> section.
<LI>
<CODE>@codeexample</CODE> is used to mark code that is excerpted in the style of a texinfo <CODE>example</CODE>.
The term <CODE>@codeexample</CODE> should appear on a line by itself, before the text of the code, and the
terms <CODE>@end codeexample</CODE> should appear on a line by itself, at the end of the text of the code.
<LI>
<CODE>@cl</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the Common Lisp language,
e.g., <CODE>@cl{defmacro}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@constant</CODE> can be used to mark constant names and values that appear in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@exception</CODE> is used to mark names of exceptions.
<LI>
<CODE>@fn</CODE> is used to mark function names that occur in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@interface</CODE> is used to mark interface names.
<LI>
<CODE>@isl</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the ILU ISL language, e.g. <CODE>@isl{SIBLING}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@java</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the Java language, e.g. <CODE>@java{class Foo;}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@kwd</CODE> is used to mark keywords that occur in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@language</CODE> is used to mark names of computer or human languages.
<LI>
<CODE>@m3</CODE> is used to mark artifacts of the Modula-3 language, e.g. <CODE>@m3{INTERFACE Foo;}</CODE>.
<LI>
<CODE>@macro</CODE> is used to mark names of macros that occur in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@message</CODE> is used to mark in-line text that is a message a program may write to its output.
<LI>
<CODE>@metavar</CODE> is used to mark meta-variables.
<LI>

which support them, such as Common Lisp package names, or Java
package names.
<LI>
<CODE>@parm</CODE> is used to mark parameter names.
<LI>
<CODE>@picture</CODE> is used to include a file containing encapsulated Postscript
of a diagram or picture.  It should appear on a line, followed by the name of the file containing the picture, followed
by a newline.  We find the InterViews tool <CODE>idraw</CODE> works well in creating
diagrams in the form of encapsulated Postscript.
<LI>
<CODE>@program</CODE> is used to mark program names that occur in the text.
<LI>
<CODE>@protocol</CODE> is used to mark names of ILU RPC protocols.
