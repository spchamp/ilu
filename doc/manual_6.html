<H1><A NAME="SEC218" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC218">Using ILU with C++</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC219" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC219">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
This document is for the C++ programmer who wishes to use 
ILU. The following sections will show how ILU is
mapped into C++ constructs and how both C++
clients and servers are generated and built.
<P>
When functions are described in this section,
they are sometimes accompanied by <I>locking comments</I>,
which describe the locking invariants maintained by ILU on a threaded system.
See the file <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT>
for more information on this locking scheme, and the types of locking comments used.
<P>
A number of macros are used in function descriptions, to indicated optional arguments, and ownership of potentially
malloc'ed objects.
The owner is responsible for freeing the object's storage at an appropriate time, and generally makes no interesting guarantees of when that will be.  Some types of objects (generally (fixed- and variable-length) arrays, including strings) are presumed to be mutable by only their owners.
The macro <CODE>OPTIONAL(<VAR>type-name</VAR>)</CODE> means that the value
is either of the type indicated by <VAR>type-name</VAR>, or the value <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  This macro
may only be used with pointer values.  The macro <CODE>RETAIN(<VAR>type-name</VAR>)</CODE>
indicates, when used on a parameter type, that the caller retains ownership of the value,
and when used on a return type, that the called function retains ownership of the
value.  The macro <CODE>PASS(<VAR>type-name</VAR>)</CODE> indicates, when used on a parameter type,
that the caller is passing ownership of the storage to the called function, and when
used on a return type, that the called function is passing ownership of the called
value to the caller.  The macro <CODE>GLOBAL(<VAR>type-name</VAR>)</CODE> means that neither
the caller nor the calling function owns the storage.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC220" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC220">Mapping ILU ISL to C++</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX607"></A>
<P>
Using ILU with C++ is intended to eventually be compatible
with the OMG CORBA specification.  That is, all of the naming
and stub generation comply with the Common Object Request Broker
Architecture specified mapping for C++, when that specification is available.
The current mapping was designed to be usable with a large number of C++
compilers, by avoiding problematic constructs such as templates, exceptions,
namespaces, and nested class definitions.
<P>
Note that ILU support for C++ does rely on having
argument prototypes, all C++ library functions, and the
capabilities of the C++ pre-processor.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX608"></A>
<H3><A NAME="SEC221" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC221">Names</A></H3>
<P>
In general, ILU constructs C++ names from ISL names
by replacing hyphens with underscores.  Type names are prepended with their interface name
and the string "_T_".  Enumeration value namess are formed
by prepending the enumeration type name and "_" to the ISL enumeration value name.
Exception names are prepended with their interface name and "_E_".
Constant names are prepended with their interface name and "_C_".
<P>
Other naming conventions may be specified explicitly; see the following section on tailoring names
for more information.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC222" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC222">Types</A></H3>
<P>
Records turn directly into C++ structs.
Unions consist of a struct with two fields:  the type discriminator, a field called "discriminator",
and a union of the possible values, called "value".
Arrays map directly into C++ arrays.  Sequences become a C++ class
with methods and representation analogous to the procedures and representation that appear in the C mapping.  Objects become normal C++ classes
that are subclasses of the pre-defined class <CODE>iluObject</CODE>.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC223" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC223">Sequence types</A></H4>
<P>
For most sequences types, the generated C++ code follows a pattern analogous to that set in the C mapping and illustrated in the upcoming example.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC224" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC224">Object types</A></H3>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC225" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC225">Exceptions</A></H3>
<P>
Because of the scarcity of implementation of the C++ exception mechanism,
exceptions are passed by adding an additional argument to the beginning of each method,
which is a pointer to a status struct, which contains an exception code, and a union of
all the possible exception value types defined in the interface.  Method implementations
set the exception code, and fill in the appropriate value of the union, to signal an
exception.  Exception codes
are represented in C++ with values of the type <CODE>ilu_Exception</CODE>.
<P>
In a true module, exceptions may be raised by using the function <CODE><VAR>&#60;interface&#62;</VAR>_G::RaiseException</CODE>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX609"></A>
<U>C++:</U> void <B><VAR><interface></VAR>_G::RaiseException</B> <I>( RETAIN(<VAR><interface></VAR>Status *) <VAR>status</VAR>, GLOBAL(ilu_Exception) <VAR>code</VAR>, ...)</I><P>
<P>
Causes an exception code and value for the exception specified by <VAR>code</VAR> to be bound
in <VAR>status</VAR>.  Besides the two required arguments, the function may take another
argument, which should be a value of the type implied by the value of <VAR>code</VAR>;
that is, of the appropriate type to be a value of the exception being signalled.
Note that <CODE>RaiseException</CODE> does not actually cause a transfer of control,
so that an explicit return statement must follow a call to <CODE>RaiseException</CODE>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC226" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC226">Constants</A></H3>
<P>
Constants are implemented with C++ <CODE>#define</CODE> statements.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC227" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC227">Examples</A></H3>
<P>
Here's a sample ISL spec, and the resulting C++ mappings:
<P>
<PRE>
INTERFACE Foo;

TYPE String = ilu.CString;
TYPE UnsignedInt = CARDINAL;

TYPE E1 = ENUMERATION val1, val2, val3=40 END;

TYPE A2 = ARRAY OF 41, 3 R1;
TYPE S1 = SEQUENCE OF E1;
TYPE U1 = UNION R1, A2 END;

CONSTANT Zero : CARDINAL = 0;

TYPE O1 = OBJECT

The C++ mapping:

<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC228" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC228">Using an ILU module from C++</A></H2>
<P>
A client module may obtain an instance of an ILU object in
three basic ways:  1)  instantiating it directly from a string binding handle,
2) using the function <CODE>iluObject::Lookup</CODE> to locate it via the
simple binding interface, and 3) receiving the instance directly as a return
value or out parameter from a method on a different object.
<P>
To instantiate from a string binding handle, a static member function is
generated for each subclass of <CODE>class iluObject</CODE> declared in the C++ stubs:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX610"></A>
<U>C++:</U> {OPTIONAL(class <B><VAR>T</VAR></B> <I>*)} <VAR>T</VAR>::ILUCreateFromSBH (ilu_CString <VAR>sbh</VAR>)</I><P>
<P>
To use the simple binding service to locate an object:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX611"></A>
<U>C++:</U> static OPTIONAL(GLOBAL(void *)) <B>iluObject::Lookup</B> <I>( RETAIN(char *) <VAR>sid</VAR>, RETAIN(char *) <VAR>ih</VAR>, ilu_Class <VAR>putative-class</VAR> )</I><P>
<P>
Locking:  Main invariant holds.
<P>
Finds and returns the object specified by the given Server ID (<VAR>sid</VAR>) and server-relative Instance Handle (<VAR>ih</VAR>) by consulting the local domain registry of objects.
<VAR>putative-class</VAR> is the type that the object is expected to be of,
though the type of the actual object returned may be a subtype of <VAR>putative-class</VAR>, cast
to the <VAR>putative-class</VAR>.  The return value should be immediately cast to a value of the C++
mapping of <VAR>putative-class</VAR>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC229" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC229">Implementing an ILU Module in C++</A></H2>
<P>
For each ILU class <CODE><VAR>interface</VAR>.<VAR>otype</VAR></CODE>,
ILU will define, in the file
<TT>`<VAR>interface</VAR>.cc'</TT>,
a C++ class called <CODE><VAR>interface</VAR>_T_<VAR>otype</VAR></CODE>.
To implement a true object for <CODE><VAR>interface</VAR>.<VAR>otype</VAR></CODE>,
one should further subclass this C++ class,
and override all of its methods.  In particular, do not let
any of the default methods for the class be called from your methods for it.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC230" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC230">Servers</A></H3>
<P>
ILU supports,
in each address space, multiple instances of something called
a <I>kernel server</I>, each of which in turn
supports some set of object instances.
A kernel server <I>export</I>s its objects by making them available
to other modules.  It may do so via one or more <I>port</I>s, which are
abstractly a tuple of (<VAR>rpc protocol</VAR>, <VAR>transport type</VAR>,
<VAR>transport address</VAR>).  For example, a typical port might
provide access to a kernel server's objects
via <CODE>(Sun RPC, TCP/IP, (host 13.24.52.9, UNIX port 2076))</CODE>.  Another port on the
same kernel server might provide access to the objects via
<CODE>(Xerox Courier, XNS SPP, XNS port 1394)</CODE>.
<P>
When creating an instance of a true object, a kernel server for it,
and an instance handle (the name by which the kernel server knows it) for
it must be determined.  These may be specified explicitly by overriding
the default <CODE>iluObject::ILUGetServer</CODE> and <CODE>iluObject::ILUGetInstanceHandle</CODE> methods,
respectively.  The <CODE>iluObject</CODE> implementation of <CODE>ILUGetServer</CODE> defers to <CODE>ilu::GetDefaultServer</CODE>.
The <CODE>iluObject</CODE> implementation of <CODE>ILUGetInstanceHandle</CODE> generates a handle that's unique relative to the kernel server.
<P>
The kernel server is represented in C++ with the class <CODE>iluServer</CODE>,
which has the following constructor:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX612"></A>
<U>C++:</U> ?? <B>iluServer::iluServer</B> <I>( OPTIONAL(const char *) <VAR>server-id</VAR>, OPTIONAL(iluObjectTable *) <VAR>object-table</VAR> )</I><P>
<P>
Constructs an instance of <CODE>class iluObject</CODE> with the given <VAR>server-id</VAR>
and <VAR>object-table</VAR>.
<P>
Note that ILU object IDs, which consist of the kernel server ID, plus the instance
handle of the object on that server, must be unique "across space
and time", as the saying goes.  If no kernel server id is specified,
ILU will generate one automatically, using an algorithm
that provides a high probability of uniqueness.  If you explicitly
specify a kernel server ID, a good technique is to use a prefix or
suffix which uniquely identifies some domain in which you can assure
the uniqueness of the remaining part of the ID.  For example, when
using ILU at some project called NIFTY at some internet
site in the IP domain <CODE>department.company.com</CODE>, one might use
kernel server IDs with names like
<CODE>something.NIFTY.department.company.com</CODE>.
<P>
Once the server is constructed, a port must be added:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX613"></A>
<U>C++:</U> ilu_Boolean <B>iluServer::AddPort</B> <I>(OPTIONAL(RETAIN(char *)) <VAR>protocol-info</VAR>, OPTIONAL(RETAIN(ilu_TransportInfo)) <VAR>transport-info</VAR>, ilu_Boolean <VAR>be-default</VAR>)</I><P>
<P>
Adds a port through which the server can be contacted.  The <VAR>protocol-info</VAR> and <VAR>transport-info</VAR> specify the RPC and transport protocols and their parameters.  The <VAR>transport-info</VAR> has a layered structure, represented by the C type <CODE>ilu_TransportInfo</CODE>, described in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT>.  See chapter 1 for a catalogue of available RPC and transport layer specifications.
<P>
To export a module for use by other modules,
simply instantiate one or more instances
of your subtype of <CODE><VAR>interface</VAR>:<VAR>otype</VAR></CODE> and (if single-threaded) call the ILU C++
event dispatching loop, <CODE>iluServer::Run</CODE>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC231" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC231">Event dispatching</A></H3>
<P>
Most non-threaded long-lived C and C++ programs
simulate threads with <I>event dispatching</I>, in which the program waits in some
piece of code called the <I>main loop</I> until an <I>event</I> such
as input arriving on a file descriptor or the expiration of an alarm
signal causes a <I>callback routine</I> to be invoked.  The ILU C++
runtime, in single-threaded mode, supports this style of operation with various static member functions
of the class <CODE>iluServer</CODE>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX614"></A>
<U>C++:</U> static ilu_Boolean <B>iluServer::RegisterInputHandler</B> <I>( int <VAR>fd</VAR>, void (*<VAR>callbackRoutine</VAR>)(int, void *), void * <VAR>callbackArg</VAR>)</I><P>
<P>
Register the file descriptor <VAR>fd</VAR> with the ILU kernel so that when
ILU kernel event dispatching is active (that is, during the <CODE>iluServer::Run</CODE> call),
the function <VAR>callbackRoutine</VAR> will be invoked with the arguments <CODE>(<VAR>fd</VAR>, <VAR>callbackArg</VAR>)</CODE>
whenever input is available on the file descriptor <VAR>fd</VAR>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX615"></A>
<U>C++:</U> static ilu_Boolean <B>iluServer::UnregisterInputHandler</B> <I>( int <VAR>fd</VAR> )</I><P>
<P>
Removes any callback routine registered on file descriptor <VAR>fd</VAR>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX616"></A>
<U>C++:</U> static ilu_Boolean <B>iluServer::Run</B> <I>( void )</I><P>
<P>
Invokes the ILU main loop and causes ILU kernel event
dispatching to be active.  This routine never returns.
<P>
Occasionally it is necessary to use a different event dispatching mechanism,
typically because some other work is done inside the main loop of the mechanism.
An alternate main loop can be registered for use with ILU by creating
a subtype of the class <CODE>iluMainLoop</CODE> and registering it with the kernel
by calling the function <CODE>iluServer::iluSetMainLoop</CODE>:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX617"></A>
<U>C++:</U> static void <B>iluServer::iluSetMainLoop</B> <I>( RETAIN(iluMainLoop *) <VAR>ml</VAR> )</I><P>
<P>
Registers the main loop object <VAR>ml</VAR> with the runtime kernel.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC232" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC232">Publishing</A></H3>
<P>
To enable users of your module find the exported objects, you may
register the string binding handle of the object or objects, along
with their type IDs, in any name service or registry that is convenient
for you.  In releases 1.6--2.0 of ILU, we support an experimental
simple binding method that allows you to "publish" an object,
which registers it in a domain-wide registry, and
then to withdraw the object, if necessary.  Potential clients can
find the string binding handle of the object by calling
a lookup function.  <STRONG>Note that this interface and service
is experimental, and may be supported differently in future releases
of the ILU system.</STRONG>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX618"></A>
<U>C++:</U> ilu_Boolean <B>iluObject::ILUPublish</B> <I>()</I><P>
<P>
A method on instances of <CODE>class iluObject</CODE>, it registers the instance with some
domain-wide registration service.
The object is known by its &#60;<VAR>Server-ID</VAR>, <VAR>Instance-Handle</VAR>&#62; pair.  Clients may find
the object by passing this pair to the <CODE>iluObject::Lookup</CODE> function.
Returns true if the object can be successfully published in the local registry.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX619"></A>
<U>C++:</U> ilu_Boolean <B>iluObject::ILUWithdraw</B> <I>()</I><P>
<P>
Returns true if the object's registration in the local registry can be successfully withdrawn,
or does not exist.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX620"></A>
<U>C++:</U> ilu_Boolean <B>iluObject::ILUPing</B> <I>(ilu_Error* p_error)</I><P>
<P>
Returns ilu_TRUE if the true object exists, and the process serving it can be contacted, otherwise ilu_FALSE.
*p_error is set if some error occurred.
<P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC234" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC234">Generating ILU stubs for C++</A></H2>
<P>
To generate C++ stubs from an ISL file, you use the
program c++-stubber.
<A NAME="IDX621"></A>
Three files are generated from the
<TT>`.isl'</TT> file (the extension <CODE>cpp</CODE> is used instead of <CODE>cc</CODE> when running on Windows):
<UL>
<LI>
<TT>`<VAR>interface-name</VAR>.hh'</TT> contains the class definitions for the types
and procedures defined by the interface;
<LI>
<TT>`<VAR>interface-name</VAR>.cc'</TT> contains the client-side and general code
for the interface; and
<LI>
<TT>`<VAR>interface-name</VAR>-server-stubs.cc'</TT> contains the server-side
stubs and code for the interface.
</UL>
Typically, clients of a module never have a need for the <TT>`<VAR>interface-name</VAR>-server-stubs.cc'</TT> file.
<P>
<PRE>
% <STRONG>c++-stubber foo.isl</STRONG>
header file interface foo to ./foo.hh...
code for interface foo to ./foo.cc...
code for server stubs of interface foo to ./foo-server-stubs.cc...
%
</PRE>
<P>
The option <CODE>-renames <VAR>renames-filename</VAR></CODE> may be used with <CODE>c++-stubber</CODE>
to specify particular C++ names for ISL types.  See the following section
for more details.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX622"></A>
<H3><A NAME="SEC235" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC235">Tailoring C++ Names</A></H3>
<P>
It is sometimes necessary to have the C++ names of an ILU interface
match some other naming scheme.  A mechanism is provided to allow the programmer to
specify the names of C++ language artifacts directly, and thus override
the automatic ISL to C++ name mappings.
<P>
To do this, you place a set of synonyms for ISL names in a
<I>renames-file</I>, and invoke the <CODE>c++-stubber</CODE> program with the switch <CODE>-renames</CODE>,
specifying the name of the renames-file.  The lines in the file are of the form
<PRE>
<VAR>construct</VAR> <VAR>ISL-name</VAR> <VAR>C++-name</VAR>
</PRE>
where <VAR>construct</VAR> is one of <CODE>method</CODE>, <CODE>exception</CODE>, <CODE>type</CODE>, <CODE>interface</CODE>,
or <CODE>constant</CODE>; <VAR>ISL-name</VAR> is the name of the construct, expressed either
as the simple name, for interface names, the concatenation
<CODE><VAR>interface-name</VAR>.<VAR>construct-name</VAR></CODE> for exceptions, types, and constants,
or <CODE><VAR>interface-name</VAR>.<VAR>type-name</VAR>.<VAR>method-name</VAR></CODE> for methods;
and <VAR>C++-name</VAR> is the name the construct should have in the generated
C++ code.  For example:
<P>
<PRE>
# change "Foo_T_R1" to plain "R1"
type Foo.R1 R1
# change name of method "M1" to "Method1"
method Foo.O1.M1 Method1
</PRE>
<P>
Lines beginning with the `hash' character <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> are treated as comment lines,
and ignored, in the renames-file.
<P>
This feature of the <CODE>c++-stubber</CODE> should be used as little and as carefully
as possible, as it can cause confusion for readers of the ISL interface,
in trying to follow the C++ code.  It can also create name conflicts
between different modules, unless names are carefully chosen.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC236" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC236">Threading</A></H2>
<P>
The ILU C++ runtime is prepared to be used in either a single-thread or a multi-threaded mode.  Single-threaded is the default.  To run multi-threaded, the application is responsible for picking a threading mechanism and making it accessible to ILU.  Two calls must be made to make a threading mechanism available to ILU.  One, <CODE>iluServer::SetFork</CODE>, enables ILU to fork new threads.  The other, <CODE>ilu_SetLockTech</CODE> (from <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT>), supplies various thread synchronization primitives.  These calls must be done at startup time, before any ILU servers are created or surrogate objects imported.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC237" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC237">Other ILU Considerations For C++</A></H2>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC238" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC238">Libraries and Linking</A></H3>
<P>
For clients of an ILU module, it is only necessary to link
with the <TT>`<VAR>interface-name</VAR>.o'</TT> file compiled from the
<TT>`<VAR>interface-name</VAR>.cc'</TT> file generated for the interface or interfaces
being used, and with the two libraries
<TT>`<VAR>ILUHOME</VAR>/lib/libilu-c++.a'</TT> and <TT>`<VAR>ILUHOME</VAR>/lib/libilu.a'</TT> (in this
order, as <TT>`libilu-c++.a'</TT> uses functions in <TT>`libilu.a'</TT>).
<P>
For implementors of true classes, or servers, the code for the server-side
stubs, in the file <TT>`<VAR>interface-name</VAR>-server-stubs.o'</TT>, compiled
from <TT>`<VAR>interface-name</VAR>-server-stubs.cc'</TT>, should be included along
with the other files and libraries.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC239" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC239">Initialization order</A></H3>
<P>
ILU uses the static-object-with-constructor trick to effect per-compilation-unit startup code.  In certain cases you'll want to ensure that a certain compilation unit's initialization is run before another's.  While C++ defines no standard way to do this, most compilers work like this: compilation units are initialized (static object construtors run) in the order in which they are given to the link-editor.  We want to hear about any exceptions to this rule.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC240" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC240">Makefiles</A></H3>
<P>
ILU uses the <CODE>imake</CODE> system from X11R? to produce
<TT>`Makefile'</TT>s from <TT>`Imakefile'</TT>s.  For more details on this process,
section <A HREF="manual_20.html#SEC580">Using Imake with ILU</A>.
