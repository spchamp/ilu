<H2><A NAME="SEC242" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC242">Introduction</A></H2>
This document is for the Java programmer who wishes to use 
ILU. The following sections will show how ILU is
mapped into Java constructs and how both Java
clients and servers are programmed.  See also <A HREF="ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/misc/ilu4java.html"><TT>ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/misc/ilu4java.html</TT></A>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC243" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC243">ILU and CORBA</A></H3>
<P>
ILU for Java is mostly CORBA compatible.  
<P>
By this we mean the normal definition of compatibility of english language or of computer science.  (In particular we don't use any other organizations definition of "compatible"):
<P>
Ilu's compatibility requires the programmers help:  Not all programs will be compatible, but it is possible to write compatible programs.
<P>
1) Ilu can interoperate with other corba compatible orbs. 
<P>
2) Applications which are written to use only corba compatible features can switch between ilu and other orbs without changing source code. 
<P>
ILU for Java's compatibility is not complete or perfect.  Not all CORBA orb functions are implemented (DII etc).  Ilu implements a subset of the CORBA functionality (for any version), as well as plugs itself into an abstract ORB support interface  (if you have a compatible orb, e.g. jdk 1.2 comes with orb delegation packages which ARE compatible). 
<P>
Ilu generated stubs are not implementing all internal functionality required by other orbs.  Stubs generated by other orbs do not provide all internal functionality required by Ilu.  This is normally not a problem for any application; should there be a problem, the Ilu stubber has a -prefix option to generate stubs into a different package.
<P>
javasoft's interpretation of the standard mapping:  (may or may not be accurate): <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/idl/docs/idl-java.html"><TT>http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/idl/docs/idl-java.html</TT></A>
<P>
The standard mapping is available from OMG as PDF document:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/orbos/97-03-01.pdf"><TT>ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/orbos/97-03-01.pdf</TT></A> or a newer version

<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC244" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC244">The ISL Mapping to Java</A></H2>
<P>
The mapping is similar to the corba mapping.  Applications programmers should not notice 
a difference whether their application use corba stubs or ILU stubs, as long as the application
stays withing the corba subset.  Many ilu types however implement the java.io.Serializable
interface.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC245" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC245">Names</A></H3>
<P>
In general ISL names are mapped to Java names and identifiers with no change. 
<P>
If a name collision could be generated in the mapped Java code, the name collision is resolved by prepending an underscore (_) to the mapped name.
<P>
This mapping, matches the CORBA standard.  ILU considers all use of java reserved words, as well as method names of class java.lang.Object to be colliding.  
<P>
Furthermore, names which have prefixes or postfixes which COULD match identifiers otherwise generated by ILU  are considered colliding. (Like "Helper", "Holder")
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC246" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC246">Interfaces</A></H3>
<P>
An ISL <CODE>interface</CODE> is mapped to a Java package with the same name.  For details see the CORBA standard for modules. 
<P>
Avoid IDL features which are not in the scope of a idl module (= ISL Interface). 
<P>
The ISL directive (DIRECTIVE-EXPERIMENTAL) options have a few special keys for the java stubber.
<P>
Directives which starts with "JAVA-PREFIX" contains a quoted string which is used as a package prefix.  This can also be achieved with a stubber command line -prefix option.
<P>
 
Directives which starts with "JAVA-CUSTOMFILE" contains a quoted string which is used as a file name describing custom mapping.  This can also be achieved with a stubber command line -custom option.
<P>
Directives which starts with "JAVA-REMOTE" contains a list of quoted string which are names of ilu object types (or "*").  Those object types will extend java.rmi.Remote and all methods will declare to throw java.rmi.RemoteException.  However, if you combine RMI remotes and ilu objects, you need to know what you are doing or you'll be surprized.   (This automaticly implies "JAVA-NOCORBAOBJECT")
<P>
Directives which starts with "JAVA-NOCORBAOBJECT" contains a list of quoted string which are names of ilu object types (or "*").  Those object types will NOT extend org.omg.CORBA.Object.  Don't use corba specific methods on those (You'd get a type error).  
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC247" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC247">Basic Types</A></H3>
<P>
BOOLEAN is mapped in to java boolean.
<P>
BYTE is mapped int java byte.  ILU carries the bit pattern, not the numerical value.
<P>
CHAR and SHORT CHAR are mapped int java char.  Values outside their range throw an exception when marshalling.
<P>
SHORT INTEGER, SHORT CARDINAL maps into java short.
<P>
INTEGER, CARDINAL map into java int.
<P>
LONG INTEGER, LONG CARDINAL map into java long.
<P>
The unsigned integer types map as bit pattern.
<P>
SHORT REAL maps into java float.
<P>
REAL maps into java double.
<P>
128 bit floating point values are carried around as "xerox.ilu.types.float128" but no operations are available.
<P>
The "new" extended IDL types fixed is not yet supported.  
<P>
This mapping matches the standard corba mapping.

<P>
At the currenbt time not yet implementing java.io.Serializable

<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC252" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC252">About Java Object serialization</A></H4>
<P>
All (*) Constructed Types are mapped into java types which implement java.io.Serializable.  Whether
the type realy is serializable depends on whether its element type is.  Serialization of a constructed type whose element type is not serializable throws an exception.  
<P>
(*) Two exceptions: Custom surrogates are only serializable if the surrogate type specified so.  
<P>
Likewise, true object type implementations are only serializable if the implementing class specified so.  The implementing class does NOT need to implement any methods, but it needs to implement java.io.Serializable
 
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC253" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC253">Enumeration</A></H4>
<P>
See the corba standard.
<P>
Serialization in an ILU context works as expected.  In PRE-JDK1.2 however, serialization in a non-ILU context might loose the object identity.  (Otherwise equal elements can be detected with "==")
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC254" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC254">Array</A></H4>
<P>
Mapped into a java array of the mapped element type.
See the corba standard.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC255" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC255">Sequence</A></H4>

<P>
See the corba standard.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC258" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC258">Optional</A></H4>
<P>
ISL Optionals have no corresponding corba type.
If the base type of the optional maps into a Java primitive type we will represent the optional with the corresponding Java wrapper or container class.  (Boolean, Character, Double, Float, Integer, Short, Byte, or Long).  The null value represents absence of the parameter.
<P>
If the base type of the optional maps into a Java object type, the optional is mapped as if it weren't optional. The null value represents absence of the parameter. 
<P>
In the case of Java Strings the difference between a null String and an empty string serves this distinction perfectly.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC259" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC259">Object Types</A></H3>
<P>
See the CORBA standard for "corba interfaces".
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC260" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC260">Surrogate and True Object Types</A></H4>
<P>
<I>To request creation of an object the <CODE><CODE>createTrueObject</CODE></CODE>
method is called.  The implementation of <CODE><CODE>createTrueObject</CODE></CODE> is expected to
call <CODE><CODE>super.returnTrueObject</CODE></CODE> to register the created object.</I>
<P>
True object have to implement all the interfaces required by their type and by type org.omg.CORBA.Object (unless the Ilu type explicitely doesn't extend org.omg.CORBA.Object)   
<P>
Unlinke, CORBA, this is all which is absolutely necessary.  However, unless
there is a need to do otherwise we strongly recommend extending the
base class xerox.ilu.IluObjectBase.  This will take care automatically of a long list
of problems (See the section about garbage collection).  But, if you can't use
one of those base classes, in ilu you do have alternatives.
<P>
If you can't extend a predefined base class, you can make a class of your
own and implement the necessary interface.  With the ilu distribution
is a "template" ObjectImpl.template which cut be pasted into your own
source code to do so automatically.  <I>See the ObjectImpl.template file in the runtime/java directory.</I>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC261" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC261">Methods, Parameters, and Exceptions</A></H4>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC262" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC262">Java Garbage Collection, Distributed Garbage Collection, and/or COLLECTIBLE</A></H4>
<P>
The Garbage Collection features in Ilu look much more difficult then they are.  The 
difficulties arise in supporting various important cases in wild combinations.  Most
likely your application will not use the whole span of complexities but simply chooses one of the cases.
<P>
For Ilu COLLECTIBLE objects (see generic Ilu documentation) do not hang onto
objects longer then you need.  That is true for both surrogate and true objects.
<P>
Non COLLECTIBLE objects are alive until deleted.  If you are providing
a true object implemementation, it is your responsibility to prevent this
object from being garbage collected; Ilu does not necessarily do so.   If the program lets a true 
object being garbage collected that means Ilu will eventually stop serving it. 
<P>
There are several means to have Ilu help keeping an object alive:  
<P>
If possible, true objects should extend IluObjectBase (or use the template).  This would take care of
all the complexities following.
<P>
Most direct,
the xerox.Ilu.registerTrueObject method provides a lifetime argument. This
should be a lifetime value as is provided by the xerox.ilu.IluLifetimeArgs
class.  However since many registrations happen implicitely or in places
which do not provide that argument there are other means to specify
lifetime.
<P>
There are two marker interfaces xerox.Ilu.IluLifetimeForget and xerox.Ilu.IluLifetimeRemember
which can be implemented by true objects.  Doing so guides Ilu's behaviour
if xerox.Ilu.registerTrueObject does not specify an explicit method or
xerox.Ilu.registerTrueObject is not explicitely used at all.  
<P>
Of course the application could simply manage the lifetime itself, but see the note below.  
<P>
Note that
there is a big difference in whether a true object is extending IluObjectBase or not.
Ilu goes to tremedous troubles to not require applications to extend a predefined
base class.  However if this service is not needed we recommend applications to
simply extend IluObjectBase for true object types.  By doing so, Ilu can take
advantage of inherited code which helps it handle lifetime.  If Ilu can finds no
hint at all that the application is doing something about the lifetime, Ilu's behaviour
might become more conservative then the programmer likes.  (For CORBA users:
using org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl.java works as well as xerox.ilu.IluObjectBase, but
you can only do corba things with it.  Use xerox.ilu.IluObjectBase otherwise.)
<P>
Note to the curious why the internal complexity is necessary:  Ilu is implementing weak refs, 
even on jdk version which have no support for it.
<P>
ILU Java reads the <CODE>ILU_COLLECTABLE_CINFO</CODE> environment variable for setting up ports for the special object used to guide collectible objecs.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC263" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC263">Java serialization</A></H4>
<P>
Surrogates implement java.io.Serializable.  We recommend to our implementors to make true object types serializable as well.  The IluObjectBase interface does so.
<P>
 
<H3><A NAME="SEC264" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC264">How to make your idl Java friendly</A></H3>
<P>
Note that you don't have to do this. Ilu will mangle your names
if necessary.
<P>
However, if you keep your names Java friendly, your stubs will be easier to read 
and debug by people used to popular java coding
standards or the CORBA standard mapping.  If you avoid name
conflicts no esoteric name mangling needs to happen and your ilu
stubs are more likely to match the CORBA standard correctly.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Avoid Java keywords.
(e.g. boolean, int, class, for, ...)
<LI>
Avoid names of Java standard classes (in the java.lang package).
(e.g. String, Integer, RuntimeException)
<LI>
Avoid suffixes which are used by CORBA standard for your type and class names.
(e.g. Stubs, Operations, Helper, Holder, ImplBase)
<LI>
Avoid prefixes which are used by CORBA standard for your type and class names.
(e.g. POA_)
<LI>
Avoid suffixes which are generated by ILU for your type and class names. 
(e.g. _exh_)
<LI>
Avoid gratuidous typedefs.
(But it is ok to use typedefs for functional reasons)
<LI>
Avoid using the same name for the interface and a type.
<LI>
As a courtesy, try to also avoid names which cause problems for other programming languages.
<LI>
Start your types, classes and exceptions with capital letters.
<LI>
Start your methods and enumeration values with small letters
</OL>

<H3><A NAME="SEC266" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC266">Servers and Ports</A></H3>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC267" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC267">True Servers</A></H4>
<P>
Each object exported by an implementation must belong to a true server,
an instance of the Java type <CODE>IluServer</CODE> which is
implemented by the <CODE><CODE>xerox.ilu.IluServer</CODE></CODE> class.
<P>
An <CODE>IluServer</CODE> instance can be created by calling the function
<CODE><CODE>ilu.createServer(<VAR>[serverID]</VAR>)</CODE></CODE>,
which returns a value of type <CODE>IluServer</CODE>.
If <VAR>serverID</VAR> is a string, it specifies the server ID;
if it is the Java value <CODE>None</CODE>, a server ID will be invented automatically.
<P>
Other methods allow the specification of a daemon flags or ports for
different transports or protocols, or an <I>object table</I>, which
allows specification of a callback function for creating true instances
on demand.
<P>
The first time a true server is created, it becomes the default server.
The default server is used for an exported object if a server is not
otherwise specified or when it is explicitly requested with the <CODE><CODE>defaultServer</CODE></CODE> method.
If an object is exported before any servers have been created,
one will be created automatically using default parameters and possibly a message
to that effect will be written to <CODE><CODE>System.err</CODE></CODE>.
<P>
An object of type <CODE><CODE>IluServer</CODE></CODE> has an accessor method
<CODE><CODE>serverId()</CODE></CODE> that returns its server ID.
<P>
<I>Look at the Java classes IluServer and IluPort for details. In general
servers may be omitted and a default server is used.  IluPort as well
may be ommited.</I>
<P>
ILU for Java reads the <CODE>ILU_DEFAULT_CINFO</CODE> environment variable for setting up default ports.
<P>
See the section Java Garbage Collection, Distributed Garbage Collection, and/or COLLECTIBLE for how to setting up the port used for implementing COLLECTIBLE objects.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC268" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC268">Object Tables</A></H4>
<P>
Object tables are defined in the class IluObjectTable.  To define an
object table one subclasses <CODE><CODE>IluObjectTable</CODE></CODE> and attached the subclasses
to an <CODE><CODE>IluServer</CODE></CODE> when the server is created.  An <CODE><CODE>IluObjectTable</CODE></CODE> can only
be attched to one <CODE><CODE>IluServer</CODE></CODE>.
<P>
<I>Because the Object Tables calls are made with internal ILU locks held, it
must not do recursive calls into ILU.</I>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC269" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC269">Threading and Event Loops</A></H3>
<P>
ILU uses Java threads.  There is no event loop option.
<P>
It is possible to change thread priorities by setting properties at
start up of the application.  This is however <EM>not</EM> recommended.
<P>
A few arguments can be passed by setting "properties" on the thread.  This
is motivated by the java standard mapping which has no place to pass
extra arguments.
<P>
However
Java threads, if not subclassed do not support "properties".  To set thread
properties, calls need be performed from an xerox.ilu.IluServiceThread
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC270" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC270">Custom Records</A></H3>
<P>
Record types are mapped to Java objects.  It is possible provide a subclass which will be used by ILU instead.  
<P>
"Custom Records" class assign their own class to a (protected) java.lang.Class variable (_theClass)
of the original stub class for the record.  Whenever ILU needs to allocate an instance
of such a record it will allocate a an instance of the subclass instead.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC271" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC271">Custom Surrogates</A></H3>
<P>
Surrogate creation can be intercepted.  To do so one registers either a
Java class, or, a factory object with the stub class
implementing an object type.  See the methods
<CODE><CODE>IluClassRep.setSurrClass</CODE></CODE> or
<CODE><CODE>IluClassRep.setSurrFactory</CODE></CODE> for details.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC272" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC272">String Binding Handle Formation</A></H3>
<P>
The class <CODE><CODE>xerox.ilu.IluSBH</CODE></CODE> provides methods for both scanning and composing
string binding handles.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC273" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC273">Simple Binding</A></H3>
<P>
An object may be published using the simple binding service by calling
the method
<BR>
<CODE><CODE>xerox.ilu.IluSimpleBinding.publish()</CODE></CODE>.
<P>
An object may be unpublished by calling the method <CODE>xerox.ilu.IluSimpleBinding.withdraw()</CODE>.
<P>
A published ILU object may be obtained by calling
<CODE><CODE>xerox.ilu.IluSimpleBinding.lookup(<VAR>sid</VAR>, <VAR>ih</VAR>, <VAR>cl</VAR>)</CODE></CODE>,
where <VAR>sid</VAR> is object's server's server ID, <VAR>ih</VAR>
is the object's instance handle, and <VAR>cl</VAR> is its ILU class.  The ILU class for a type <VAR>TYPE</VAR> may
be obtained in Java by calling <CODE><VAR>TYPE</VAR>Stub.iluClass()</CODE>.
<P>
As alternative to IluSimpleBinding, the <CODE><CODE>resolve_initial_references</CODE></CODE> method from org.omg.CORBA.ORB could be used.  See another alternative in the chapter about CosNaming.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC274" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC274">Principal Identities and Passports</A></H3>
<P>
Passport are represented in the class <CODE>IluPassport</CODE>.  Identities are represented by the class <CODE>IluIdentity</CODE>.   The class <CODE>IluIdentityType</CODE> represents the type of an identity.  A passport can carry at most one IluIdentity of each <CODE>IluIdentityType</CODE>.
<P>
Client generated passports are mutable and stay alive until garbage collected.  Clients tell 
ILU about their passports via the current thread which must be a subclass of IluServiceThread.
The methods <CODE>IluServiceThread.setMyStubPassport</CODE> and <CODE>IluServiceThread.setStubPassport</CODE> can be used to set passports.   For security reasons passports of other threads can not be set.  (We need to rethink the possible threats).  However it is possible to clear the passport of any thread (as this is only a denial of service attack).
<P>
ILU generated passports are immutable and can be used only while the call for which
it has been constructed is ongoing.  If used afterwards, an exception will be raised.  For a client to access an Ilu generated passports, the method <CODE>IluPassport.getSkeletonPassport</CODE> is used.
<P>
These passport features are carried around fully, but since the api to create identities and identity type features are still missing, usefullness of passports is grossly limited.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC275" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC275">Building ILU-for-Java Applications</A></H2>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC276" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC276">Stub Generation</A></H3>
<P>
<I>Please don't confuse the java stubber (called javah) with the ilu stubber (called java-stubber).  javah is used to create native method interfaces.  java-stubber is named that way to provide a naming scheme matching other ilu stubbers for other programing languages.</I>
<P>
To generate Java stubs from an ISL file, use the
program <CODE>java-stubber</CODE>.  Since the
stubber creates a surprisingly large number of Java files,
these files must be directed to a designated stub directory.  
<P>
Using a designated stub directory is only a default and could be changed.  We strongly advice against changing this to protect your manually written source files from being overwritten.   
<P>
To be able to compile the huge list of files, the stubber generates a file with a list of generated Java files is
generated.
<P>
The stubber recognizes the following options or switches:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>-dir <VAR>DIRECTORY PATH</VAR></B><BR>
The stubs are generated into the
directory specified by the <VAR>DIRECTORY PATH</VAR> argument.  This
command line option could direct the stubs into the working directory,
but if omitted the default path is <TT>`./javastubs'</TT>.
<LI>
<B>-xrx</B><BR>
The old Xerox PARC Java/ILU mapping is used for this interface.  (See also <B>-omg</B>.)
The main difference between <B>-xrx</B> and <B>-omg</B> option are the
holder classes; we are working on eliminating this difference.
<LI>
<B>-omg</B><BR>
More or less what we imagine is OMG's mapping for this
interface is used.  Remember that this is about the interface to the application, not about the interface to the orb.
<LI>
<B>-flat</B><BR>
Generate all stubs into the designated stub directory
directly.  This is not recommended because files can be overwritten.
The default behavior is to write stubs in subdirectories according to
their interface names.
<LI>
<B>-prefix <VAR>PACKAGE_PREFIX</VAR></B><BR>
Generates stubs into a package prefixed with the named <VAR>PACKAGE_PREFIX</VAR>.
<LI>
<B>-noprefix</B><BR>
Generates stubs without package prefix.  Recommended for serious interfaces; NOT recommended for experimenting.
<LI>
<B>-noserv</B><BR>
Generates stubs which save a few bytes but can't be used on the true side. NOT recommended.
<LI>
<B>-reportfile <VAR>REPORT-FILENAME</VAR></B><BR>
Additional parameter for a file name.  A list of
generated Java files is generated.  This list can be used to
make makefiles, etc.  <B>-reportfile</B> has no `suffix' version (see below).
<LI>
<B>-noreport</B><BR>
The list of generated Java files is <EM>not</EM> generated.
<B>-noreport</B> has no `suffix' version (see below).
<LI>
<B>-exsuffix</B><BR>
Define a suffix used in the name of exceptions. NOT recommended.
</UL>
<P>
All command line options (unless if documented otherwise)
have a second variant with a suffix "<B>1</B>".  If the command line option
with suffix is used, an extra argument for the name of an interface is
read, and the option only affects that interface.
The un-suffixed command line options affect all
interfaces.  Suffixed command line options override un-suffixed command
line options.  Option processing is from left to right.
<P>
The stubber can be run without arguments to generate a usage message.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC277" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC277">Problems and Solutions</A></H4>

<LI>
<B>Stubbing will create a very large number of files with the
Java extension.  You don't want to loose your source files
among the generated stubs.</B><BR>
We recommend creating a subdirectory
called <TT>`./javastubs/'</TT>.  All generated stubs should be generated
into this directory.  (This is the default; we do not recommend
changes.)  <I>(As a safety measure) if a non-standard directory is used,
the stubber does NOT create it automatically.  Unlike the top level stub
directory, sub directories are created automatically by the stubber.</I>

Use good ILU interface names (Or OMG IDL module names).
This is recommended for "production" ILU use.

Direct the stubber to generate all stubs into a prefix package stubs.
This is recommended for perusing non-well-known interfaces.
Use the <B>-prefix</B> option to name a prefix.

A Java program which wants to implement a object type

implements the stubber-generated Java interface
<CODE>I</CODE> and java class org.omg.Object (Preferably by extending the xerox.ilu.IluObjectBase class).  Objects of this class then are 
made available (registered) with the
ILU runtime either implicitly or explicitly, or with an object

<P>
Explicit registration allows specification of additional parameters,
like the string binding handle, the server, and more.  Explicit
registration done by calling the stubber generated method
<CODE><CODE>I.<VAR>T</VAR>_stub.registerTrueObject()</CODE></CODE>.  As an
alternative, if the programmer is willing to specify the class, he can
also use the method <CODE><CODE>xerox.ilu.Ilu.registerTrueObject</CODE></CODE> directly.

<H2><A NAME="SEC285" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC285">Notes for ILU for Java in applets</A></H2>
<P>
Use of ILU in applets is not impossible, but it is not fully supported either.
Read about the problems to see what you can do and what you can't.
<P>
The highlevel problem are native code and no support for class unloading.
<P>
ILU has native methods.  That means Ilu must be loaded somewhere/somehow where
native methods are supported.  ILU has been loaded into Hotjava, java-plugin (Activator).
This can be solved in JDK 1.1 by loading ILU on the classpath, or by using signed applets (which has not been tested).
<P>
ILU also has been loaded into the regular Netscape 4.05 VM, but that needs special setup
in the Ilu build process.  (See Imakefile and source/runtime/java/IluMozillaExtra.java).
This has not been tested in the recent release and is depricated in favor of plugin.
<P>
In JDK1.2 Ilu can be made an installed extension.  (Downloaded extension in JDK1.2 don't yet support native methods, even when signed).  If you run Ilu as an extension you also need the stubs in the extension, otherwise the classloader would throw a security exception.
<P>
Likewise, if you manage to put Ilu into the bootclasses you also need the stubs in the bootclasses, for the same reason.
<P>
To run Ilu as an extenson, out the jar files in the proper extension directory, but don't forget to put the native code into the right place also.  
<P>
ILU does not support class unloading.  ILU itself is quite security aware, but there are still some problems.  In particular, there is a security problem if an applet loads malicious
stubs and later another applet things these are correct stubs.  To prevent class
unloading, stubs should be in the same classloader as the ILU runtime:  Either both signed and dynamic, or both on the classpath, or, both as an extension.
<P>
Very little testing of running ILU in a browser or a java-pluggin has been done.  Set up your
environment that stub classes will never be unloaded.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC289" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC289">Native threads versus green threads</A></H3>
<P>
On UNIX systems, Sun's Java runtime exports one or both of two different interfaces to its multi-threading support, depending on which of two implementations is used.  The choice is between so-called "green threads", which are "user level" threads entirely implemented in the Java runtime, and "native threads", which use the thread support offered by the OS and/or C runtime.
<P>
On Win32 systems, only native threads are available.  
In case that the ILU for Java system is built with JNI, the difference between
"green threads", and "native threads" does not matter.
<P>
ILU faces the choice between native and green threads at two times.  The first is when ILU is built: ILU can be built for use with either or both kinds of Java threading system.  ILU's configuration script (used at ILU build time) tries to figure out which kind(s) of Java threads are available in the local Java implementation and build ILU support for as many kind(s) of Java threads as are available.  If it gets this wrong, you can explicitly tell it which kind(s) of threads to build support for, with a configuration option: <CODE>--with-java-threads=<VAR>KINDS</VAR></CODE>, where <VAR>KINDS</VAR> is one of <CODE>green</CODE>, <CODE>native</CODE>, or <CODE>both</CODE>.
<P>
The second time when ILU must choose between Java threading systems is at loading time for Java native code library.  Sadly we do not know how to determine whether Java is using green threads or native threads.  ILU simply tries one version, and, if that throws an exception and another version is available, tries the other version.  (The order is important: on a certain Java VM and threading model the wrong native code didn't throw exceptions but caused a crash.)
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC290" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC290">JNI versus ONI vesus RNI</A></H3>
<P>
Ilu is configured differently according to what native method interface is used by your java VM.  Mostly, the configuration step will choose the right system for you.
<P>
The choice of RNI is quite obvious:  Use RNI on microsoft sdk and nowhere else.  (This 
happens automatically)
<P>
The choice of JNI versus ONI is more difficult.
	
In jdk1.1 we recommend using ONI because JNI doesn't implement weak pointers, the java VM's don't do compaction, and, ONI has been used in most testing.
	
In jdk1.2 we recommend using ONI IF your system supports ONI and does NOT
use memory compaction.   Otherwise we recommend using JNI.
		
The ILU configuartion process chooses automaticly whether to use JNI or ONI.  Should this choice be wrong, it can be overridden with the <CODE>--with-java-jni</CODE> option.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC291" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC291">Java releases</A></H3>
<P>
The ilu build builds one version of binary ilu.  However, the filenames for the 
binaries are distinct.  It is possible to do one ilu build for jdk1.1 and one ilu build 
for jdk1.2... each in the same
directory.  This works because the by accident or design, the java classes for 
jdk 1.1 and jdk1.2 are compatible.  Ilu at runtime decides which version of
the native libraries to load.
<P>
Ilu used to work with various jdk1.2beta releases but after usage of jdk1.2 Ilu
went through major changes in the configuration and beta releases have thereafter never been tested anymore. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC292" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC292">CosNaming</A></H2>
<P>
Sadly, Ilu stubs and standard stubs are not interchangable.  In Java jdk1.2 the org.omg.CosNaming stubs are in the Java core and Ilu has no chance of substituting its own stubs.  There are two possible ways to handle this problem:
<P>
a)  This is for people who want to use Ilu strictly corba compatible.  Stub the CosNaming.idl with the standard org.omg prefix.   Load a version of java which does not have CosNaming from another source.  If an application can do this its use of CosNaming is corba compatible in source code.   (It is always corba compatible on the wire).
<P>
b) If your application can not replace the standard CosNaming packages.  Stub the CosNaming.idl with another prefix, for example xorg.omg.  The stubs will have a different
package name, but they will be corba compatible on the wire.
<P>
We recommend using CosNaming.idl from ilu's etc/CosNaming directory.  The reason for
this is that the idl does not have a package prefix in the module name but only as
a pragma.   So whatever prefix is generated when stubbing CosNaming.idl, the names used on the wire get picked from the pragma and your CosNaming stubs look right on the wire.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC293" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC293">CosNaming Naming Server</A></H3>
<P>
Should you use ILU's CosNaming Naming Server?  It really doesn't matter.  The
service is wire compatible and accessed via your stubs.  Ilu's service and somebody
elses service are interchangeable.
  
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC294" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC294">Bootstrapping with CosNaming</A></H3>
<P>
It is possible to start up Ilu like a regular orb and bootstrap via the CosNaming
service.  There is an example in the chapter about the ORB class.  See also <A HREF="ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/misc/iluSunJavaIDL.html"><TT>ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/misc/iluSunJavaIDL.html</TT></A>
<P>
You will need to specify that ILU is used as the ORB.  To do this use a
property like this:  -Dorg.omg.CORBA.ORBClass=xerox.ilu.IluORB.
<P>
You will need to force your application to load the required stubs.  use a
property like this:  -Dilu.load=xorg.omg.CosNaming._allJavaStubs:HelloApp._allJavaStubs
This usage demonstrates loading both, the stubs from CosNaming as well as the stubs from the application.
<P>
You will need to tell ILU what the string binding handle of the root context of the naming
service is.  One way is to copy the IOR from when the naming service was started, as a propert like this: -DNameService=IOR:000000000000002849444c3a6f6d672e6f72672f436f734e616d696e672f4e616d696e67436f6e746578743a312e3000000000010000000000000044000100000000001b7275626265726475636b792e706172632e7865726f782e636f6d000080ac000000000018afabcafe00000002446942fc000000080000000000000000
<P>
The other way is to write the IOR into a file or an URL.   In unix this could even be done by redirecting the output when starting the naming service.   Use a property like this to read the IOR from a file:  -DNameService=file:/tmp/file.temp or like this to read a URL:   -DNameService=url:http://x.y.com/foo.htm
<P>
You might  use the xerox.ilu.IluORB.resolve_initial_sbh or xerox.ilu.IluORB.readSBHFromURL methods directly to make up your own way of bootstrapping Ilu.

With jdk1.1 you need to manually create an images subdirectory and copy the images.  (This has been fixed in jdk1.2).  Since I don't know how to make the ilu build find the images, the build does not do the javadoc step automatically. 
<P>
Another reason to not automatically build the javadoc documentation is that different users might want to or not include -package and -private features.  The third reason for manual build is that some users might want to include standard packages into the same documentation build.  For some java release the way to make javadoc comments is this:
<P>
<PRE>
# create a javadocs directory
# we recommend using ILUHOME/doc/javadocs

<P>
The above example loads the CosNaming stubs from the command line.  The reason for this
is to make sure that the stubs are actually loaded before orb.resolve_initial_references
is called.  Ilu requires types to be known (stubs loaded) before an object of that type is read, otherwise
the type information will be lost. 
<P>
<B>Warning:</B>  In jdk1.2 the CosNaming stubs are in the java core and not
replaceable by Ilu.  This example works only jdk1.1 based, or in jdk1.2 when fooling with the boot class path.   In regular jdk1.2 use we recommend changing the package prefix for the CosNaming stubs, maybe use xorg.omg instead org.omg (therefore also update the application and the -Dilu.load properties).

An IluSerializationContext represents an instance of the serialization

code receives calls in the same order as the client application
code makes them, except that calls made after a barrier call can
start service before calls made before the same barrier call.  A
barrier call is one that raises a system exception whose
completion status is MAYBE (in CORBA terms, which are not quite
right to use here) or that raises the barrier error.  The client
may not issue any two of these calls concurrently. &#60;p&#62;

<H2><A NAME="SEC306" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC306">Full Custom Mapping</A></H2>
<P>
Full custom mapping is the ability to externally specify how an isl type
shall be mapped to java.  
<P>
It is similar to custom records and custom objects, however there is no
requirement for the custom mapped type to be a subtype of the regular
mapping.  
<P>
There is the restriction that custom mapping works
only java object types; not basic types.  In particular, the regular mapping of the ilu 
type needs to map into a java object type, as well as the custom
mapped type must be a java object type.  
<P>
Full custom mapping is used solely in one
address space; communicating ilu processes might not know whether
or how an ilu type is custom mapped in the other address space.
<P>
All stubs in one address space however must agree on the mapping of
any ilu type.
<P>
Custom mapping is started using isl DOCUMENTATION options or stubber 
command line options, however there
needs to be also runtime code which handles the conversion from and to
the regular mapped object.
<P>
For full information, check the ILUSRC/etc/javaobv  and the ILUSRC/examples/testjavaobv directories.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC307" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC307">Stubbing</A></H4>

<P>
When stubbing the custom mapping could also be specified with an
commandline option
<PRE>
	-custom description-file-name

<P>
We are using a file to describe the custom mapping because the actual description 
too cumberson for command line options and must be 
set identical for all stubs accessing a custom mapped type.

<H3><A NAME="SEC309" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC309">Java objects by value, Java marshalled objects</A></H3>
<P>
Ilu has a package which supports transmitting arbitrary java
objects through ILU.  To non-Java applications these look
like regular ILU records containing bytes; to Java applications
these are very specific Java classes.
<P>
This is implemented using full custom mapping using the
java type java.lang.Object for ILU types and using java serialization
to convert to and from regular ILU records at runtime.
<P>
The isl types xerox.ilujava.JavaObject is used to describe an 
arbitrary java.lang.Object.  The java objects assigned to a ILU
type ilujava.JavaObject are converted automaticly when transitting
or receiving the objects.  The Java application never sees the internal representation.
Choose objects by value for direct communications between
clients and servers which want to deal with life objects.
<P>
The isl types xerox.ilujava.MarshalledObject maps into a java
object containing the serialized contents of a java object.  Java
objects are externalized or internalized explicitely before when
converting to xerox.ilujava.MarshalledObject.   The convertion
routines are in the java class xerox.ilujava.IluMarshaller. Choose 
marshalled objects when the types
are use in "dead" services which don't automaticly
want to internalize the objects, e.g. For registrations
in a name service or database. 
<P>
Java objects must satisfy one of these conditions to be used as
xerox.ilujava.JavaObject or xerox.ilujava.MarshalledObject.
<OL>

<LI>The xerox.ilujava.MarshalledObject type itself (rather its custom record aequivalent)
</OL>
<P>
Restriction on Ilu object types:  When internalizing, the implementing Java class MUST be loaded.
Ilu deserialization of Ilu types can not load implementations:  At deserialization time ilu locks
may be held which might prevent ilu type registrations.  Given this general problem, we don't even bother storing the Java class with the sbh used to represent an ilu object type.
<P>
Of course, to a non-java applications both the xerox.ilujava.JavaObject and xerox.ilujava.MarshalledObject types look
like their regular ISL records with gibberish sequences of bytes, 
as internalizing requires a
Java VM.
<P>
Whether the classes are actually transmitted through the
ilu connection or loaded by other means now is part
of the state of the ilu-serialized object.  The package
generalizes over this aspect and class loading schemes can (MUST)
be registered.  Use the xerox.ilujava.IluMarshaller.setDefaultAccessMethod method.
<P>
The 
xerox.ilujava.IluMarshaller class has methods by which 
classloader functionality can be registered.  (Method: xerox.ilujava.IluMarshaller.registerClassLoaderGetter).
<P>
The directory
also contains a classloader which transmits class bytes
through the same ilu connection.  This classloader is
unsafe, unless you can guarantee the true object
of the classloader only sends valid and safe class bytes.
Arbitrary mechanisms and security can be implemented
using the registration mechanisms.
<P>
Another class loader is provided which loads the
code through an URL.  (This loader requires JDK1.2)
<P>
A more ideal world would decide on objects by value versus
marshalled objects semantics on a more dynamic base.  This
is however difficult as they would need to be stubbed differently.  
Current ILU supports some choice dymamicly as it allows to transmit
a xerox.ilujava.MarshalledObject where a xerox.ilujava.JavaObject
is expected.  In this case the other end will get a xerox.ilujava.MarshalledObject
as expected; that is the reason xerox.ilujava.MarshalledObject are
"serializable".
<P>
Users of Java objects by value or Java marshalled objects must make the
classes available, e.g by putting the ILUHOME/lib/ilujavaobv.jar jar
file onto the classpath.
<P>
For more information, check the ILUSRC/etc/javaobv directory.
<P>
An example application is in the ILUSRC/examples/testjavaobv directory.  
The demo program shows how to
transmit arbitrary (though serializable) java objects.
<P>
This application even transmits Java classes (byte codes) through
ilu.  Unlike RMI, the class itself is passed through ILU.  We do not
claim the simpler mechanism of RMI wouldn't be sufficient, but 
by specifying access of the byte codes we can better show
the power of the mechanisms.

ILU-serialization and Java-serialization
<P>
Do NOT confuse ILU's serialization to with java's standard serialization.
The two mechanism are different, however they DO interact.
<P>
Ilu stubs do implement java.io.Serializable.  This
is in support of this package.  Java-serialization and Java-de-serialization
for some ILU types depends on substitution performed in this package and 
may not work with generic java-serializable applications, ie. RMI.  Most
ILU generated stubs work perfectly with RMI.     
<P>
Java-Deserialization requires ILU being loaded.  
<P>
Most important compatibility:   Any java-serializable object can be ilu-serialized.  The ILU MarshalledObject type is java-serializable.
<P>
ILU-serialization and Corba compatibility
<P>
The serialization adds features to ILU stubs.  They do not interfere with the
source code level compatibility.  However standard Corba stubs will not have
these features and would interfer with ILU-serialization. 
 
<P>
The ISL types supporting serialized ILU objects contain no feature which couldn't be represented
with standard IDL files, but the IDL file has not yet been written.
<P>
ILU-serialization and non-java ILU applications
<P>
To other other programming languages ILU-serialized objects look like
ILU records with fields and sequences of bytes containing gibberish.  The
important point is:  Such records can be handled, stored, and, passed along
and become life again when forwarded into ILU for Java.
