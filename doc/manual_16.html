<P>
ILU includes a number of internal interfaces that allow
various functionality of the ILU kernel library to be
replaced by user functionality.
<UL>
<LI>
In a single-threaded application,
the entire "main loop" can be replaced; in a threaded application,
features of the thread system can be described to the ILU kernel so
that the kernel will use them.  
<LI>
New messaging protocols and inter-address-space transport mechanisms
can be registered for use by an application.
<LI>
Object incarnation routines can be registered for `kernel servers',
so that true instances can be created on reference, rather than
before reference.
<LI>
URL parsing routines can be registered for various URL schemes,
so that application-specific object URLs can be used.
<LI>
New identity schemes can be defined and registered with the kernel
to support application-specific authorization and accounting schemes.
<LI>
Handler routines can be registered to deal with <CODE><CODE>malloc()</CODE></CODE> failures
in application-specific ways.
<LI>
Handler routines can be registered to perform application-specific
actions when errors are signalled.
<LI>
If debugging is enabled at configuration time, specific sets of debugging messages can
be selected at run time, and an application routine can be defined to intercept
and handle debugging messages.
</UL>
Most of these interfaces are defined in two ILU source files,
<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT> and <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluntrnl.h'</TT>.
We will not attempt to duplicate that documentation here, to avoid the inevitable errors
when documentation is provided in two different forms;
rather, this section of the manual will provide sketches of the
interfaces, and refer the reader to the appropriate header files.
For any discrepancies noted between the material here, and the material in the
header files, the header files should be assumed to the `truth'.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC510" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC510">Event Loops and Threads</A></H2>
<P>
Every ILU address space uses either real threads, or some sort of event dispatching
loop to simulate threads.  ILU is thread-safe internally, and by default will continue to check its usage for
even when event dispatching is used.  Since many different thread systems and event dispatching
loops exist, ILU provides interfaces to allow the user to describe the particular
one that they're using to the ILU kernel.  See section section <A HREF="manual_13.html#SEC463">Threads and Event Loops</A>
for more information on these topics.  See <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT> for
documentation of the interfaces.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC511" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC511">RPC Protocols and Data Transport Mechanisms</A></H2>
<P>
The ILU remote procedure call mechanism operates in layers.
<UL>
<LI>
The application, at the highest layer, calls down into language-specific,
interface-specific stub code, passing language-specific, method-specific values;
<LI>
that stub code calls down into an
interface-independent language-specific runtime layer, passing method-independent, but language-specific
values;
<LI>
that LSR calls down into language-independent, interface-independent ILU `kernel'
code, passing simple C values;
<LI>
the kernel calls into the code for a specific RPC
protocol, such as ONC RPC, passing C values;
<LI>
the protocol code calls
down into transport-mechanism code, passing `messages' as opaque byte sequences;
<LI>
the transport code, which may consist of several layers, may perform various
transformations on the messages, and finally conveys them to the peer transport layers.
</UL>
ILU includes registration mechanisms to allow applications to add to the
kinds of RPC protocols and data transport mechanisms that can be used.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC512" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC512">RPC Protocols</A></H3>
<P>
Each <CODE><CODE>ilu_Protocol</CODE></CODE> object reflects a particular mapping of the
abstract ILU RPC protocol onto a specific externally-defined RPC protocol.
(See section <A HREF="manual_14.html#SEC475">Protocols and Transports</A> for a discussion of the abstract ILU protocol,
and how it is mapped to the ONC RPC protocol, and to the XNS Courier
protocol.)
<P>
New RPC message protocols can be added to the ILU kernel
by writing a new <CODE><CODE>ilu_Protocol</CODE></CODE>
object, and calling the ILU kernel function <CODE><CODE>ilu_RegisterProtocol()</CODE></CODE>.
register it.  The structure and
requirements of an <CODE><CODE>ilu_Protocol</CODE></CODE> object are defined in the file
<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluprotocol.h'</TT>; the methods of the protocol
are considered to be `inside' the ILU kernel, and must therefore conform
to all ILU locking and error conventions.  The locking conventions
are discussed in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT>; the error
conventions are documented in
<BR>
<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluerror.h'</TT>,
and pre-defined errors are documented in
<BR>
<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluerrs.h'</TT>.
<P>
Various examples of ILU protocols are available for study:
<UL>
<LI>
the ONC RPC mapping (<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/sunrpc.c'</TT>
<LI>
the XNS Courier protocol (<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/courier.c'</TT>)
<LI>
the OMG Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iiop.c'</TT>)
<LI>
the World Wide Web Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/http.c'</TT>)
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC513" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC513">Transport Filters</A></H3>
<P>
In general, ILU protocols form `messages' consisting of sequences of bytes,
which are then passed to the ILU transport layer to be conveyed to another
address space.  The transport layer itself is composed of one or more ILU <I>transport filter</I>s,
each of which handles the message in turn.  These filters are either communication
filters, such as the filters which actually convey messages via TCP/IP or UDP/IP,
or transformation filters, which alter the message and pass it to
another transport filter, such as the ONC RPC record-marking filter, or
the secure transport filter.
<P>
Each transport filter is either <I>reliable</I> or <I>unreliable</I>.
All transformation filters are reliable; communication filters may or may not
be reliable.  A communication filter is reliable if it guarantees that any messages
handed to it for transport will be reliably delivered to the other end of the
communication connection.  This in turn means that the communication mechanism
used by the transport will take care of timeouts, retries, etc., internally,
so that the ILU application need not worry about these itself.
Unreliable communication filters are those which may require ILU
participation in timeout and resending of messages to achieve reliable delivery.
<P>
Each filter is also either <I>boundaried</I> or <I>non-boundaried</I>.  Boundaried filters
are those which can comprehend and preserve message boundaries.  Non-boundaried
filters simply deal in chunks of bytes and have no way to recognize or
preserve message boundaries.  Various protocols and filters may have requirements
as to whether the next filter below it in the communication stack is boundaried
or non-boundaried.
<P>
New transport filters may be registered with the ILU kernel by
calling the kernel function <CODE><CODE>ilu_RegisterTransport()</CODE></CODE>, described in
<TT>`<VAR>ILU</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT>, with the name of a new
transport filter and the address of a routine which returns an instance
of the new transport object type.  Implementing a new transport
object type actually consists of implementing several related object types,
including <CODE><CODE>ilu_TransportCreator</CODE></CODE>, <CODE><CODE>ilu_TransportClass</CODE></CODE>,
and <CODE><CODE>ilu_Mooring</CODE></CODE>.  These object types are defined in the
file <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/ilutransport.h'</TT>.
<P>
As with protocols, the methods of the transport filter
are considered to be `inside' the ILU kernel, and must therefore conform
to all ILU locking and error conventions.  The locking conventions
are discussed in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT>; the error
conventions are documented in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluerror.h'</TT>,
and pre-defined errors are documented in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluerrs.h'</TT>.
<P>
Examples of transformation filters may be found
in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/sunrpcrm.c'</TT>, which is a boundaried filter implementing
ONC RPC's TCP/IP record marking scheme, and
<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/security.c'</TT>, which is a non-boundaried filter implementing
message integrity, sender authentication, and message privacy.  Examples of communication
filters may be found in
<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/newtcp.c'</TT>, which is a non-boundaried reliable filter implementing
data communication via TCP/IP,
<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/udp.c'</TT>, which is a non-boundaried unreliable filter implementing
data communication via UDP/IP,
and
<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/inmem.c'</TT>, which is a boundaried reliable filter implementing
intra-address-space communication via memory buffers.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC514" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC514">Object Incarnation Procedures</A></H2>
<P>
ILU true objects live in <I>kernel server</I>s, a kernel data structure
that handles communication and other aspects of the object implementation.  When
an object reference is received from another address space, the kernel server is
responsible for mapping this reference to an actual object.  Normally, the kernel server
simply consults an internal hash table for an object corresponding to a specified
`instance handle'; however, an application may register an application-specific
callback function to be used instead.  This allows on-the-fly creation of objects,
which is often vital when handling many objects.  Actual in-memory representations
of the objects can be garbage-collected, then dynamically re-incarnated when
needed by a client.
<P>
The application registers this functionality by creating an implementation of
an <CODE><CODE>ilu_ObjectTable</CODE></CODE> object, and passing that implementation as a parameter
to <CODE><CODE>ilu_CreateTrueServer</CODE></CODE> when creating the kernel server.  Typically,
<CODE><CODE>ilu_CreateTrueServer</CODE></CODE> is called directly only by a language-specific runtime;
the actual application would work with object tables via whatever mechanism is
exported by the language-specific runtime.  Check the documentation for your
particular language runtime for more information.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC515" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC515">Object URLs</A></H2>
<P>
ILU regards string binding handles generically as a way of
encoding four pieces of information: the instance handle for an object,
the server ID for an object, the most-specific type ID (MSTID) for an
object, and communication information about how to communicate with that
object, which we call <I>contact-info</I>.  It further restricts them to
conform to the URL syntax specified in the World Wide Web Consortium and
IETF standard RFC 1738
(<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Addressing/rfc1738.txt"><TT>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Addressing/rfc1738.txt</TT></A>).  But this
still allows ILU to support any number of URL schemes, which we
define as some way of encoding these four pieces of information which
conforms to the URL syntax rules.
<P>
The default URL scheme is called <CODE>ilu:</CODE>, and encodes the information as
<P>
<CODE>ilu:<VAR>&#60;server-id&#62;</VAR>/<VAR>&#60;instance-handle&#62;</VAR>;<VAR>&#60;MSTID&#62;</VAR>;<VAR>&#60;contact-info&#62;</VAR></CODE>
<P>
Most of these elements consist of US-ASCII strings with various additional constraints.
The strings are encoded in what is called the <I>SBH element encoded form</I>:
the set of
alphanumeric characters plus the 4 characters DOLLAR (<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>), HYPHEN (<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>), PERIOD (<SAMP>`.'</SAMP>), and PLUS (<SAMP>`+'</SAMP>)
are represented by the character itself; other characters are escaped via
the mechanism specified in RFC 1738:  each is represented with 3 characters, a PERCENT (<SAMP>`%'</SAMP>) character followed by
two hexadecimal digits giving the US-ASCII character code for the escaped character.
<P>
The non-encoded form of the <VAR>&#60;server-id&#62;</VAR> and <VAR>&#60;instance-handle&#62;</VAR> strings may contain any character
except for US-ASCII NUL.
<P>
The non-encoded form of the <VAR>&#60;MSTID&#62;</VAR> consists of the following
<P>
<CODE><VAR>&#60;type-id-scheme&#62;</VAR>:<VAR>&#60;type-id&#62;</VAR></CODE>
<P>
where the <VAR>&#60;type-id-scheme&#62;</VAR> consists of US-ASCII alphanumeric characters, and any constraints
on <VAR>&#60;type-id&#62;</VAR> are specified by the <VAR>&#60;type-id-scheme&#62;</VAR>.
<P>
The <VAR>&#60;contact-info&#62;</VAR> is not encoded in the same way as the other fields.
Rather, it consists of a series of communication info fields, separated by SEMICOLON (<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>) characters.
Each communications info field has the form
<P>
<CODE><VAR>&#60;protocol-info&#62;</VAR>@<VAR>&#60;transport-layer&#62;</VAR>[=<VAR>&#60;transport-layer&#62;</VAR>...]</CODE>
<P>
where each of the <VAR>&#60;protocol-info&#62;</VAR> and <VAR>&#60;transport-layer&#62;</VAR> elements
contain SBH element-encoded strings.  The non-encoded form of these strings has an
additional constraint:  each must begin with the name or identifier for the protocol
or transport layer it specifies, optionally followed by an UNDERSCORE (<SAMP>`_'</SAMP>) character
and any parameters for the protocol or transport.
The name of the protocol or transport may not contain any UNDERSCORE (<SAMP>`_'</SAMP>) characters.
There are no additional ILU constraints
on the formats used to represent parameters for the protocol or transport.
<P>
An application
can register a parser for one or more application-specific URL schemes
by calling the function <CODE><CODE>ilu_RegisterSBHParser</CODE></CODE>.  It takes as an argument a function
which will accept a URL string, and return the four components required by ILU.
For instance, you might want to use a URL scheme for
the OMG CORBA <CODE>IIOP</CODE> something like
<P>
<CODE>iiop_1_0://<VAR>&#60;hostname&#62;</VAR>:<VAR>&#60;port&#62;</VAR>/<VAR>&#60;server-id&#62;</VAR>/<VAR>&#60;ih&#62;</VAR></CODE>
<P>
which can be considered to contain an instance handle of <VAR>&#60;ih&#62;</VAR>, a server ID of
<VAR>&#60;server-id&#62;</VAR>, an implicit object type of <CODE>IDL:omg.org/CORBA/Object:1.0</CODE>, 
and contact-info of<BR><CODE>iiop_1_0_1@tcp_<VAR>&#60;hostname&#62;</VAR>_<VAR>&#60;port&#62;</VAR></CODE>.
<P>
Or, you might want to use an <CODE>HTTP</CODE> URL for an ILU object which
is exported via the <CODE>HTTP</CODE> ILU protocol.  Suppose that the normal ILU
string binding handle for the object was
<P>
<CODE>ilu:tcp_1.2.3.4_20000//http_obj0;ilu:Ilu_Http_Type;http_1_0@tcp_1.2.3.4_20000</CODE>
<P>
An alternate form which would be compatible with Web browsers would be
<P>
<CODE>http://1.2.3.4:20000//http_obj0</CODE>
<P>
with an implicit server ID of <CODE>tcp_1.2.3.4_20000</CODE>, an implicit MSTID of 
<CODE>ilu:Ilu_Http_Type</CODE>, an instance handle of <CODE>/http_obj0</CODE>,
and contact-info of <CODE>http_1_0@tcp_1.2.3.4_20000</CODE>.
<P>
See the <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT> for details on how
to use<BR><CODE><CODE>ilu_RegisterSBHParser</CODE></CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC516" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC516">Identity Types</A></H2>
<P>
As discussed in section <A HREF="manual_15.html#SEC499">Identities</A>, application-specific identity types can be
registered with the ILU kernel for use with various authorization and
accounting schemes, and to support various forms of security in wire protocols
and transports.  An application does this by creating a new value of type <CODE>ilu_IdentityType</CODE>,
as specified in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT>, and calling the
kernel function <CODE>ilu_RegisterIdentityType</CODE>.  After this is done, values of the new identity
types may be used.  The major use for these identity types is to work together with
new application-specific RPC protocols and message transports (described above),
to implement various security and access policies for distributed systems.
<P>
Note that the mere act of registering a new identity type with the ILU
kernel will not cause values of that identity type to be automatically transmitted
in ILU calls.  This will only happen if an appropriately designed transport
or protocol, which knows to do this, is also used.  For experimental purposes, we
provide a switch will will cause the various flavors of <CODE>Sun RPC</CODE> implemented for ILU
to automatically pass <EM>one</EM> specific identity type.  To enable this, set the
environment variable <CODE>ILU_SUNRPC_PREFERRED_IDENTITY</CODE> to the name of the identity
type to be passed automatically before running any of your ILU programs.
<P>
By default, the <CODE>Sun RPC</CODE> protocols will automatically pass the UNIX
identification of the caller (the user id, group id, host IP address, and list of
groups to which the caller belongs).  The identity type for this information is
called <CODE>"SunRPCAuthUnixIdentity"</CODE>.  To prevent its being passed automatically,
set the environment variable <CODE>ILU_NO_SUNRPC_UNIX_AUTH</CODE> to any value before
running your ILU programs.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC517" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC517">Malloc Failure Recovery</A></H2>
<P>
ILU uses a number of internal interfaces to allocate and free memory,
such as <CODE><CODE>ilu_malloc()</CODE></CODE>, <CODE><CODE>ilu_free()</CODE></CODE>, and <CODE><CODE>ilu_realloc()</CODE></CODE>.
These functions wrap calls to the standard <CODE><CODE>malloc()</CODE></CODE>, etc., in wrappers
that allow for better error handling.  They are documented in
<P>
<TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT>.
<P>
Applications can register callback functions to handle <CODE>malloc</CODE> failures,
in two ways.  The kernel function <CODE><CODE>ilu_AddFreer()</CODE></CODE> allows registration
of routines which can be called to free up memory, to allow a <CODE>malloc</CODE> call
to succeed.  The kernel functions <CODE><CODE>ilu_SetMemFaultAction()</CODE></CODE> and
<CODE><CODE>ilu_SetMemFaultConsumer()</CODE></CODE> allow applications to determine what action
should be taken if a <CODE>malloc</CODE> failure occurs.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC518" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC518">Error Reporting</A></H2>
<P>
ILU includes a comprehensive error-signalling system in the kernel library,
which is documented in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluerror.h'</TT>.  In addition,
the kernel library contains many calls to <CODE><CODE>_ilu_Assert</CODE></CODE>, which check that
various kernel invariants are maintained.  When a runtime assertion fails,
the kernel may either call an application-specified failure handler, set
by a call to <CODE><CODE>ilu_SetAssertionFailureConsumer()</CODE></CODE>, or take one of three
default actions, chosen by a call on <CODE><CODE>ilu_SetAssertionFailureAction()</CODE></CODE>.
The three default actions are (1) to generate an illegal instruction trap,
and thus coredump; (2) to exit with some error code; and (3) to enter an endless
loop, calling <CODE><CODE>sleep()</CODE></CODE> repeatedly.  The third action is the default
action; the intent is to stop the program with all invalid data intact on the
stack, and network connections intact, so that a debugger may attach to the `live' process.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC519" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC519">Debugging Interfaces</A></H2>
<P>
The ILU kernel contains a large number of debugging print statements,
which document various things going on inside the kernel.  The specific things
printed may be controlled by calling either <CODE><CODE>ilu_SetDebugLevel()</CODE></CODE> or
<CODE><CODE>ilu_SetDebugLevelViaString()</CODE></CODE>.  The specific bits which can be specified
to <CODE><CODE>ilu_SetDebugLevel()</CODE></CODE>, or names which can be specified to
<CODE><CODE>ilu_SetDebugLevelViaString()</CODE></CODE>, are documented <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iludebug.h'</TT>.
<P>
All debugging messages are displayed via calls to the kernel function <CODE><CODE>ilu_DebugPrintf()</CODE></CODE>.
Normally, this routine simply calls <CODE>vfprintf (stderr, ...)</CODE> to actually output the messages.
However, this can be changed to call some
application-specific message output system by calling <CODE><CODE>ilu_SetDebugMessageHandler()</CODE></CODE>,
documented in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT>.  Two special values
are defined for, and accepted by, <CODE><CODE>ilu_SetDebugMessageHandler()</CODE></CODE>; the value
<CODE><CODE>ILU_DEFAULT_DEBUG_MESSAGE_HANDLER</CODE></CODE> causes the debug system to revert to the
original output handler; the value <CODE><CODE>ILU_NIL_DEBUG_MESSAGE_HANDLER</CODE></CODE> causes the debug system to
simply discard any debugging messages.
<P>
Debugging output can be directed to a file, by calling <CODE><CODE>ilu_SendDebugOutputToFile()</CODE></CODE> with
a filename as an argument.  The file will be created, and debugging messages will be written to it.
