<H1><A NAME="SEC625" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC625">The ILU Common Lisp Portable DEFSYSTEM Module</A></H1>
<P>
The ILU Common Lisp support uses files called `sysdcl's to describe the generated lisp
files for a particular interface.  A <I>sysdcl</I> is similar to a UNIX `Makefile',
in that it describes the dependencies of the files of a module on each other.  As part of ILU,
we supply an implementation of a sysdcl interpreter, implemented in the <CODE>DEFSYSTEM</CODE> package (which
is also nicknamed <CODE>PDEFSYS</CODE>).  The notion is that to load a module, the user loads
the sysdcl which describes it, then uses the <CODE>DEFSYSTEM</CODE> commands to compile and
load the files of that module.  The rest of this section describes this system in more
detail.  All symbols described here are in the <CODE>pdefsys</CODE> package unless otherwise
specified.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX833"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>pdefsys:set-system-source-file</B> <I>(NAME <CODE>string</CODE>) (PATHNAME <CODE>pathname</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
Informs the defsystem utility that the definition of the system name can be
found by loading the file pathname.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX834"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>pdefsys:load-system-def</B> <I>(NAME <CODE>(or symbol string)</CODE> &optional (RELOAD <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>t</CODE>) => <CODE>boolean</CODE></I><P>
<P>
If there is a system named name and reload is false (the default), does nothing.
Otherwise, loads the system defintion from a file.  If <CODE>pdefsys:set-system-source-file</CODE>
has been used to give an explicit source file for the system defintion, that
file is used.  Otherwise the file <TT>`<VAR>NAME</VAR>-sysdcl.lisp'</TT> is loaded from the
directory specified in <CODE>pdefsys:*sysdcl-pathname-defaults*</CODE> if such a file exists.
Returns false if the system was not loaded and is not already defined, true
otherwise.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX835"></A>
<U>Variable:</U> <B>pdefsys:*sysdcl-pathname-defaults*</B><P>
<P>
Specifies the location for system declaration files.
<CODE>*sysdcl-pathname-defaults*</CODE> is a list of pathnames; each location is
searched for the declaration file.  The default value is <CODE>(list #P"/import/commonlisp-library/sysdcl/")</CODE>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX836"></A>
<U>Macro:</U> <B>pdefsys:defsystem</B> <I>(NAME <CODE>string</CODE>) (SYSTEM-OPTIONS <CODE>plist</CODE>) &rest (MODULE-DESCRIPTIONS <CODE>module-list</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
The name of the system (which is interned in the current package), is used
by defsystem to allow dependencies between multiple systems.
<P>
The <VAR>SYSTEM-OPTIONS</VAR> is a plist which may contain each of the following
keywords:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:default-pathname</CODE> (<CODE>(or string pathname)</CODE>)
<P>
The default place in which to find files; this value defaults to the null 
string.  This argument is evaluated (unlike most of the others).
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:default-binary-pathname</CODE> (<CODE>(or string pathname)</CODE>)
<P>
The default location in which to place and look for binaries.  This defaults to
the value of the :default-pathname option.  This argument is evaluated (unlike
most of the others).
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:default-package</CODE> (<CODE>(or symbol package)</CODE>)
<P>
The default package to load/compile modules in; this value defaults to the
current package.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:default-optimizations</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>)
<P>
List of default compiler optimizations settings to use when compiling modules.
If <CODE>nil</CODE>, optimization levels are not changed.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:needed-systems</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>)
<P>
A list of subsystems; this value defaults to <CODE>nil</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:load-before-compile</CODE> (<CODE>(or boolean list)</CODE>)
<P>
A list of subsystems needed for compilation; this value defaults to <CODE>nil</CODE>.  A
value of <CODE>T</CODE> means all needed subsystems.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
The module-descriptions is a list of modules which make up a system.  A 
module is a list whose car is the module name and whose cdr is a list of
keywords and values.  The module keywords may contain each of the following:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:load-before-compile</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>)
<P>
The load-before-compile keyword specifies a list of modules which will cause
this module to be recompiled.  If any of listed modules is newer then the
current module; the current module will be recompiled.  If the current module is
recompiled the list of recompile dependencies will be loaded first.
<P>
This is also a recursive recompilation.  If foo dependends on bar and bar
is out of date then bar will be recompiled before foo is recompiled.
<P>
A value of <CODE>T</CODE> means all modules that occur earlier in the system definition. This
value defaults to <CODE>nil</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:load-after</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>)
<P>
The load-after keyword specifies a list of modules which should be loaded before
the current module is loaded.  This option is useful only for modules during
compilation since the load order will normally be satisfied during a
load-system.  A value of <CODE>T</CODE> means all modules that occur earlier in the system
definition.  This value defaults to <CODE>nil</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:pathname</CODE> (<CODE>(or string pathname)</CODE>)
<P>
The pathname keyword specifies a pathname to find the current module.
Normally the pathname is the result of the concatenation of the default
pathname for the system and the module name.  This value defaults to <CODE>nil</CODE>.
This argument is evaluated, unlike the other module options.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:binary-pathname</CODE> (<CODE>(or string pathname)</CODE>)
Specifies the pathname for the binary of the current module.  Defaults to the
pathname with the same directory &#38; name as the module source, with an
appropriate file type.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:package</CODE> (<CODE>(or symbol package)</CODE>)
The package keyword specifies a package in which to load/compile the current
module.  Normally the package is the default package for the system.
This value defaults to <CODE>nil</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:compile-satisfies-load</CODE> (<CODE>boolean</CODE>)
The compile-satisfies-load keyword specifies that compiling the current
module will satisfy a load (and hence the current module will not be loaded
during a compile).  This option is useful only for files containing macros.
This value defaults to false.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:language</CODE> (<CODE>keyword</CODE>)
The language the source is written in.  See the variable <CODE>pdefsys:*language-descriptions*</CODE>
for further info.  The default is :LISP.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:optimizations</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>)
List of compiler optimization settings to use when compiling the module.  A
useful value for lisp might be ((SPEED 3) (SAFETY 0)); for C ("-O").  If not
present, the system's default-optimizations are used.  If they too are absent,
the current settings are used.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:libraries</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>)
List of object libraries to load when the module is loaded.  This is
only useful for languages like C.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:features</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>)
Run-time conditionialization, similar to #+.  The module is used iff the
features is "true" in the same way that #+ interpretes the features.
Additionally, features may be <CODE>T</CODE> (the default) which is always true, or a list of
features which is true iff at least one of the features matches.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:eval-after</CODE> (<CODE>form</CODE>)
If present, a form that will be evaluated after the module is loaded.  It
should be noted that this is evaluated each time the module is loaded,
whether or not the coresponding -file- is loaded.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:binary-only</CODE> (<CODE>boolean</CODE>)
If true, declares that there is no source file associated with the module.  No
attempt will be name to compile it.  Defaults to false.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX837"></A>
<U>Variable:</U> <B>pdefsys:*language-descriptions*</B><P>
<P>
An alist describing how files written in different languages are compiled and
loaded.  Each entry in the list is of the form (language-name source-file-type
binary-file-type compile-fn load-fn).  The language-name is the (keyword) name
of the language.  Source-file-type and binary-file-type are lists of strings;
they are the file-types for source and binary files for the language.  The
compile-fn is symbol that will be called with three arguments to compile the
source file; the pathname of the source file, the pathname of the binary output
file, and a list of the optimizations declared for the module.  Load-fn is a
symbol that will be called with two required argument to load the binary file:
the pathname of the binary, and a list of object library files to use.
<P>
The initial value of *language-descriptions* contains a description of <CODE>:lisp</CODE>, <CODE>:k&#38;r-c</CODE> and
<CODE>:ansi-c</CODE> languages.  The description of <CODE>:lisp</CODE> uses the second argument to the
compile-fn as a list of compiler optimization settings.  The description of <CODE>:k&#38;r-c</CODE> and <CODE>:ansi-c</CODE>
uses the list as a set of additional arguments to pass to the C compiler.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX838"></A>
<U>Macro:</U> <B>pdefsys:undefsystem</B> <I>(NAME <CODE>(or symbol string)</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
This macro removes the named system description from the list of all systems.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX839"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>pdefsys:load-system</B> <I>(NAME <CODE>(or symbol string)</CODE>) &key (RELOAD <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>nil</CODE>) (RECURSE <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>nil</CODE>) (TRACE <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>nil</CODE>) (SOURCE-IF-NEWER <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>nil</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
This function loads the modules of the system with the specified name and is
called recursively for all required systems.  While the system is being loaded,
the special variable <CODE>pdefsys:*current-system*</CODE> is bound to the name of the system.
<P>
The keyword args act as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>
<VAR>RELOAD</VAR>
<P>
The reload keyword, if true, specifies that a full reload of all system modules
and required systems, regardless of need.  This value defaults to false.
<P>
<LI>
<VAR>RECURSE</VAR>
<P>
If recurse is true, required systems are reloaded if the currently loaded
version is not up-to-date or if the reload option is true.  If recurse is false
(the default), a required subsystem is not loaded if there is already a version
loaded.
<P>
<LI>
<VAR>TRACE</VAR>
<P>
If true, no module or subsystem is actually loaded.  Instead a message is
printed out informing you of what would have been loaded.  The default value is
false.
<P>
<LI>
<VAR>SOURCE-IF-NEWER</VAR>
<P>
If true and a module's source is newer than its binary, or the binary does not exist,
the source will be loaded.  In all other cases, the binary will be loaded.  The
default value is false.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX840"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>pdefsys:compile-system</B> <I>(NAME <CODE>(or string symbol)</CODE>) &key (RECOMPILE <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>nil</CODE>) (RELOAD <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>nil</CODE>) (PROPAGATE <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>nil</CODE>) (TRACE <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>nil</CODE>) (INCLUDE-COMPONENTS <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>nil</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
This function compiles the modules of the system with the specified name
and is called recursively for all required systems.  While the system is being
compiled, the special variable <CODE>pdefsys:*current-system*</CODE> is bound to the name of the system.
<P>
The keyword args act as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>
<VAR>RECOMPILE</VAR>
<P>
The recompile keyword, if true, specifies that all modules should be recompiled,
regardless of need.  This value defaults to false.
<P>
<LI>
<VAR>INCLUDE-COMPONENTS</VAR>
<P>
The include-components keyword, if true, specifies that compile-system should 
load all required systems.  This value defaults to true.
<P>
<LI>
<VAR>RELOAD</VAR>
<P>
The reload keyword, if true, specifies that a full reload of all system modules
and required systems, regardless of need.  This value defaults to false.
<P>
<LI>
<VAR>PROPAGATE</VAR>
<P>
If true, the compile propagates to all subsystems (those required to load and to
compile this system).  The default is false.
<P>
<LI>
<VAR>TRACE</VAR>
<P>
If true, no module of subsystem is actually compiled.  Instead a message is
printed out informing you of what would have been done.  The default value is
false.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX841"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>pdefsys:show-system</B> <I>(NAME <CODE>(or string symbol)</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
This function outputs a formatted description of the system with the 
specified <VAR>NAME</VAR>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC626" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC626">Pathname Support</A></H2>
<P>
Some lisps don't yet support the structured directories specified
in CLtL2 (p. 620).  To support those lisps, <CODE>pdefsys</CODE> contains
two functions which do support some of that functionality.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX842"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>pdefsys:make-pathname</B> <I>&key host device directory name type version defaults</I><P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX843"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>pdefsys:pathname-directory</B> <I>pathname</I><P>
<P>
These functions shadow the functions in the <CODE>common-lisp</CODE> package, and support the
subdirectory list syntax described as follows (From the X3J13 PATHNAME-SUBDIRECTORY-LIST proposal):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is impossible to write portable code that can produce a pathname
in a subdirectory of a hierarchical file system. This defeats much of
the purpose of the pathname abstraction.
<P>
According to CLtL, only a string is a portable value for the directory
component of a pathname.  Thus in order to denote a subdirectory, the use
of punctuation characters (such as dots, slashes, or backslashes) would
be necessary. The very fact that such syntax varies from host to host
means that although the representation might be "portable", the code
using that representation is not portable.
<P>
This problem is even worse for programs running on machines on a network
that can retrieve files from multiple hosts, each using a different OS
and thus different subdirectory punctuation.
<P>
Proposal:
<P>
Allow the value of a pathname's directory component to be a list.  The
car of the list is one of the symbols :ABSOLUTE or :RELATIVE.
Each remaining element of the list is a string or a symbol (see below).
Each string names a single level of directory structure.  The strings
should contain only the directory names themselves -- no punctuation
characters.
<P>
A list whose car is the symbol :ABSOLUTE represents a directory path
starting from the root directory.  The list (:ABSOLUTE) represents
the root directory.  The list (:ABSOLUTE "foo" "bar" "baz") represents
the directory called "/foo/bar/baz" in Unix [except possibly for
alphabetic case -- that is the subject of a separate issue].
<P>
A list whose car is the symbol :RELATIVE represents a directory path
starting from a default directory.  The list (:RELATIVE) has the same
meaning as <CODE>nil</CODE> and hence is not used.  The list (:RELATIVE "foo" "bar")
represents the directory named "bar" in the directory named "foo" in the
default directory.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here's an sample sysdcl file that shows how the DEFSYSTEM functions and these
pathname functions work together.
