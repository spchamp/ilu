<H2><A NAME="SEC357" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC357">Introduction</A></H2>
This document is for the Scheme programmer who wishes to use 
ILU. The following sections will show how ILU is
mapped into Scheme constructs and how both Scheme
clients and servers are generated and built.
<P>
The Scheme support in ILU was kindly donated by<BR>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC359" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC359">Names</A></H3>
<P>
The mapping of ISL names to Scheme names for objects and methods are described
in the following sections.  For all other ISL types and exceptions
the Scheme name will be <VAR>module-name</VAR>:name.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC360" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC360">Basic Types</A></H3>
<P>
This section describes the mapping of ISL types to Scheme types.  Note
that some mappings use extra precision where it is not necessary.  This is
because the Scheme types have no finer distinctions for these
types.  The basic ISL types have the following mapping to Scheme constructs:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>ISL <CODE>boolean</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>boolean</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>short cardinal</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>cardinal</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>long cardinal</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>pair (unsigned long . unsigned long)</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>short integer</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>long</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>integer</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>long</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>long int</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>pair (long . unsigned long)</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>short real</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>double precision real</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>real</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>double precision real</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>short character</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>character</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>character</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>long</CODE>;
<LI>ISL <CODE>byte</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>character</CODE>.
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC361" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC361">Constant</A></H4>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC362" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC362">Strings</A></H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>ISL <CODE>string</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>string</CODE>.
<LI>ISL <CODE>wstring</CODE> is mapped to Scheme <CODE>vector of unsigned longs</CODE>.
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC363" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC363">Pickles and Typecodes</A></H3>
<P>
Not implemented yet.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC364" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC364">Constructed Types</A></H3>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC365" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC365">Enumeration</A></H4>
<P>
Implemented with a set of symbols bound to the integer values of the enumeration type.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC366" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC366">Array</A></H4>
<P>
Arrays are implemented as Scheme <CODE>vector</CODE>s.
For arrays, a Scheme function will be generated that takes no arguments
and returns a vector with dimensions corresponding to the ISL array type.
The user is responsible for setting elements in the vector.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC367" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC367">Sequence</A></H4>
<P>
Sequences are implemented as <CODE>list</CODE>s, except for sequences of
characters, which are implemented as <CODE>string</CODE>s.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC368" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC368">Record</A></H4>
<P>
Each record is mapped to an ILU-YASOS object.  Each object has a
constructor named (make-<VAR>module-name</VAR>:<VAR>record-name</VAR>) that takes
no arguments.  Each object also has methods to get and set all the fields
of that record.  These accessors follow the pattern of
(get-<VAR>field-name</VAR> obj) and (set-<VAR>field-name</VAR> obj value). In the
future record constructors will be able to take arguments to initialize
their fields.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC369" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC369">Union</A></H4>
<P>
Unions are implemented as a cons'ed value, with the cdr containing
the union type discriminant, and the cdr containing the actual value.
For union types, a constructor function taking two arguments is created.  The first
argument is the discriminator and the second is the union value.  The
discriminator of a union can be accessed or set using the <CODE>car</CODE> and
<CODE>set-car!</CODE> functions, respectively.  The value of a union can be
accessed or set using the <CODE>cdr</CODE> and <CODE>set-cdr!</CODE> functions,
respectively.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC370" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC370">Optional</A></H4>
<P>
Either <CODE>#f</CODE> or the value.  Note that this mapping is broken
for optional boolean types.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC371" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC371">Object Types</A></H3>
<P>
Each object is mapped to an ILU-YASOS object.
<P>
Each object type has a constructor named (make-<VAR>module-name</VAR>:<VAR>object-name</VAR>)
that takes no arguments.  The user should not attempt to create objects
using the constructor since these are surrogate objects and not true
objects.  All the method names should map exactly as they appear in the
ISL definition.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC372" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC372">Surrogate and True Object Types</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX653"></A>
<A NAME="IDX654"></A>
<U>Class:</U> <B>ilu:object</B><P>
<P>
This is the root class of all objects in the
Scheme LSR.  It provides some basic functionality required by all ILU
objects.  The public methods are described below.  Since ILU-YASOS has
no notion of public or private there are additional methods which are
not described here and should not ever be called by the user.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>(string-binding-handle <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - return the string binding handle of <VAR>obj</VAR>
<LI><CODE>(publish <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - publish this object.  Returns a boolean value for success or failure.
<LI><CODE>(withdraw <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - withdraw this object.  Returns a boolean value for success or failure.
<LI><CODE>(class-name <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - return the class name for this object.
<LI><CODE>(class-id <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - return the class id for this object.
<LI><CODE>(get-server <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - get the kernel server that controls this object.
<LI><CODE>(get-instance-handle <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - get the instance handle for this object.
<LI><CODE>(get-kernel-server <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - get the true server for this object.
<LI><CODE>(get-instance-class-record <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - get the instance class record for this object.
<LI><CODE>(destroy <VAR>obj</VAR>)</CODE> - destroy this surrogate object.  Unfortunately,
ILU-YASOS objects are not hooked into the scheme garbage collector
yet.  So, the destroy method must be called when you are finished
with a surrogate object to prevent memory leaks.
</UL>
<P>
Surrogate objects present an interface to access a true objects
which may or may not live in the same address space as the
surrogate object.  The user is not allowed to create their own
surrogate objects.  They must be looked up using a name binding
service or through the use if a string binding handle.
<P>
Behind every surrogate object there must be a true object.  The
user is in charge of defining true objects.  Implementing a true
object for a particular surrogate object is accomplished by
subclassing the surrogate object class provided by the Scheme
stubber.  Each true object implementation must override every
method of the surrogate "parent" object to work correctly.  See
the section on ILU-YASOS for implementing objects in Scheme.
Also, see the examples of a Scheme client and server given in the
examples/test1 directory.
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT CAVEAT</B>:  When using multiple inheritance with
ILU-YASOS objects to implement "true" objects it is important that
the correct ILU class record be assigned to the true object.  The
class record of the last class listed in the superclass list of
the object definition will be the one used for the object being
defined.  If this is not the desired class record, the implementor
must set it by hand.  (Hopefully, in the future this will be taken
care of automatically).  Usually, this is not a problem if you
always place the most specific superclass of an object last in the
list of superclasses.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC373" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC373">Methods, Parameters, and Exceptions</A></H4>
<P>
All methods take at least two arguments in addition to any other
arguments specified in the ISL definition.  The first argument is
the object the method is being called on and the second argument is
the status object.  The remaining arguments are the same as in the ISL
definition.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX655"></A>
<A NAME="IDX656"></A>
<U>Class:</U> <B>ilu:status</B><P>
<P>
This is a status object type, used to record the success or
failure of all method calls.  Later this will be replaced with catch
and throw.  Also note that even though individual modules create their
own status types, the ilu:status type can still be used in their place.
<P>
<CODE>ilu:status</CODE> objects support the following methods:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>(get-return-code <VAR>this</VAR>)</CODE> - get the return code for this status
object.  If the value is ilu:success then the method call was
successful. Any other value indicates an exception string, which
can be printed.
<LI><CODE>(set-return-code <VAR>this</VAR> code)</CODE> - set the return code of this status
object.
<LI><CODE>(get-status-value <VAR>this</VAR>)</CODE> - get the value associated with any
exception raised in this status object.  If the call was successful
this field should be #f.  Otherwise it will contain the contents of
an exception record.
<LI><CODE>(set-status-value <VAR>this</VAR> value)</CODE> - set the status value of this
status object.  Used for setting additional information when an
exception is raised.
<LI><CODE>(get-caller-passport <VAR>this</VAR>)</CODE> - get the passport for this method
call.
<LI><CODE>(set-caller-passport <VAR>this</VAR> passport)</CODE> - set the passport for this
method call.
</UL>
<P>
Normal methods are called in the following manner:<BR>
<CODE>(<VAR>method-name</VAR> <VAR>object</VAR> <VAR>status</VAR> <VAR>arguments</VAR>)</CODE><BR>
If any errors are encountered while
executing the method, they will be stored in the status object
parameter.  Failed method calls always return <CODE>#f</CODE>.
<P>
Arguments defined as "out" must still be passed as placeholders
even though their values are ignored.  The return values of methods
are as follows:  If the method has no "inout" or "out" parameters,
a single value is returned.  When a method has "inout" or "out"
parameters the method returns a list of values which contains any
"inout" and "out" values (in the order they are specified in the
ISL definition) followed by the "normal" return value as the last
element of the list.
<P>
All exceptions are raised by setting the return code of a status
value to something other than ilu:success.  Depending on the type
of the exception there may also be additional data associated with
it that can be set using the "set-status-value" method on a status
object.
<P>
Asynchronous methods are available in the Scheme LSR.  They will
return immediatedly with a return value of #t.
<P>
Functional methods are currently not supported in the Scheme LSR.
At the moment they are treated as normal method calls.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC374" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC374">Garbage Collection and COLLECTIBLE</A></H4>
<P>
At the moment garbage collection of surrogate and true objects is
not supported.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC378" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC378">Threading and Event Loops</A></H3>
<P>
At the moment the Scheme LSR does not support threading, so only the
event loop mode of operation will work.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC384" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC384">Initialization order</A></H3>
<P>
All object and type definitions are initialized automatically when
loading the Scheme code for a particular interface.  The (ilu:init)
function is used to initialize the GC server and callback object.
If the user wishes to select their own main loop object, they must
register it before calling (ilu:init).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC385" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC385">ILU-YASOS</A></H3>
<P>
The ILU version of YASOS is a slightly modified version of the
standard YASOS with the following differences:
<UL>
<LI>All the standard YASOS functions are prepended with the prefix
"ilu-", so regular YASOS and ILU-YASOS can operate together.
<LI>All ILU-YASOS methods make take a variable number of arguments.
This is so the same method may take different numbers of arguments
depending on which object it is called with.
<LI>An additional function called ilu-bind-arguments is provided to
extract multiple arguments from a list and bind them to symbols
(almost like a let block).  It is provided only as a convienience and
is not a required part of a method definition.
