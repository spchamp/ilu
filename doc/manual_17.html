<H1><A NAME="SEC520" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC520">Debugging ILU Programs</A></H1>
<P>
This document describes some of the common errors that occur with the use of ILU,
and some techniques for dealing with them.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC521" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC521">ILU trace debugging</A></H2>
<P>
ILU contains a number of trace statements that allow you to observe the progress of
certain operations within the ILU kernel.  To enable these, you can set the environment
variable <CODE>ILU_DEBUG</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX784"></A>
with the command
<CODE>setenv ILU_DEBUG "<VAR>xxx</VAR>:<VAR>yyy</VAR>:<VAR>zzz</VAR>:..."</CODE>
where <VAR>xxx</VAR>, <VAR>yyy</VAR>, and <VAR>zzz</VAR> are the names of various trace classes.
The classes are (as of December 1997) <CODE>packet</CODE>, <CODE>connection</CODE>,
<CODE>incoming</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>,
<CODE>authentication</CODE>,
<CODE>object</CODE>, <CODE>sunrpc</CODE>, <CODE>courier</CODE>, <CODE>dcerpc</CODE>, <CODE>call</CODE>,
<CODE>tcp</CODE>, <CODE>udp</CODE>, <CODE>xnsspp</CODE>,
<CODE>gc</CODE>, <CODE>lock</CODE>, <CODE>server</CODE>, <CODE>malloc</CODE>, <CODE>mainloop</CODE>, <CODE>iiop</CODE>, <CODE>http</CODE>, <CODE>error</CODE>, <CODE>sunrpcrm</CODE>, <CODE>inmem</CODE>, <CODE>security</CODE> <CODE>thread</CODE>, <CODE>lsr</CODE>, <CODE>type</CODE> and <CODE>binding</CODE>. The special class <CODE>ALL</CODE> will enable all trace statements:  <CODE>setenv ILU_DEBUG ALL</CODE>.  
The special class <CODE>MOST</CODE> will enable all trace statements except <CODE>lock</CODE>,  and <CODE>malloc</CODE>:  <CODE>setenv ILU_DEBUG MOST</CODE>.  
The environment variable <CODE>ILU_DEBUG_FILE</CODE> 
<A NAME="IDX785"></A>
may be used to direct debugging output to a file; if the filename includes the string <CODE>*PID*</CODE>, the first occurrence is replaced by the process ID.
The function <CODE>ilu_SetDebugLevelViaString(char *trace_classes)</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX786"></A>
may also be called from
an application program or debugger, to enable tracing.  The argument <VAR>trace_classes</VAR>
should be formatted as described above.
<P>
<CODE>ILU_DEBUG</CODE> may also be set to an unsigned integer value, where each bit set in the binary
version of the number corresponds to one of the above trace classes.  For a list of the
various bit values, see the file <TT>`<VAR>ILUHOME</VAR>/include/iludebug.h'</TT>.  Again, you can
also enable the tracing from a program or from a debugger, by calling the
routine <CODE>ilu_SetDebugLevel(unsigned long trace_bits)</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX787"></A>
with an unsigned integer argument.
<P>
The routine <CODE>ilu_SetDebugMessageHandler</CODE> allows
an application to specify an alternate routine to be called when an error
or debugging message is to be printed.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX788"></A>
<U>[ILU kernel]:</U> void <B>ilu_SetDebugMessageHandler</B> <I>(void (*<VAR>handler</VAR>) (char *formatSpec, va_list args))</I><P>
<P>
Locking:  unconstrained
<P>
Registers <VAR>handler</VAR> with the ILU kernel to be called
whenever a debugging or error message is output via <CODE><CODE>ilu_DebugPrintf</CODE></CODE>, instead
of the default handler, which simply prints the message to <CODE>stderr</CODE>, using <CODE><CODE>vfprintf</CODE></CODE>.
Two special constant values for <VAR>handler</VAR> are defined, <CODE><CODE>ILU_DEFAULT_DEBUG_MESSAGE_HANDLER</CODE></CODE>,
which will cause the default behavior to be resumed, and
<CODE><CODE>ILU_NIL_DEBUG_MESSAGE_HANDLER</CODE></CODE>, which will cause debugging and
error messages to be simply, silently, discarded.
<P>
<B>Note for Windows users:</B>  Please refer to the chapter "Using ILU with Microsoft Windows" to see how ILU trace debugging is
handled for Windows applications.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC522" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC522">Debugging ISL</A></H2>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC523" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC523">Use of <CODE>islscan</CODE></A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX789"></A>
<P>
The <CODE>islscan</CODE> program is supplied as part of the ILU
release.  It runs the ISL parser against a file containing an
interface, and prints a "report" on the interface to standard output.
It can therefor be used to check the syntax of an interface before
running any language stubbers.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC524" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC524">The ISLDEBUG environment variable</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX790"></A>
<P>
Setting the environment variable <CODE>ISLDEBUG</CODE> to any value (say, "t"),
before running any ILU stubber or the program <CODE>islscan</CODE>,
will cause ILU's parser to print out its state transitions as
it parses the ISL file.  If you're having a serious problem finding
a bug in your ISL file, this might help.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC525" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC525">C++ static instance initialization</A></H2>
<P>
Our support for C++ currently depends on having the constructors for all
static instances run before <CODE>main()</CODE> is called.  If your compiler or interpreter
doesn't support that, you will experience odd behavior.  The C++ language
does not strictly mandate that this initialization will be performed, but most compilers
seem to arrange things that way.  We'd like to see how many compilers <EM>do not</EM>;
if yours doesn't, please send a note to <CODE>ilu-bugs@parc.xerox.com</CODE> telling us
what the compiler is.
<P>
ILU uses the static-object-with-constructor trick to effect per-compilation-unit startup code.  In certain cases you'll want to ensure that a certain compilation unit's initialization is run before another's.  While C++ defines no standard way to do this, most compilers work like this: compilation units are initialized (static object construtors run) in the order in which they are given to the link-editor.  We (<CODE>ilu-bugs@parc.xerox.com</CODE>) want to hear about any exceptions to this rule.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC526" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC526">Use of <CODE>gdb</CODE></A></H2>
<P>
When using ILU with C++ or C or even Common Lisp,
running under the GNU debugger <CODE>gdb</CODE> can be helpful for
finding segmentation violations and other system errors.
<P>
ILU provides a debugging trace
feature which can be set from <CODE>gdb</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX791"></A>
with the following command:
<P>
<PRE>
(gdb) <STRONG>p ilu_SetDebugLevel(0x<VAR>XXX</VAR>)</STRONG>
ilu_SetDebugLevel:  setting debug mask from 0x0 to 0x<VAR>XXX</VAR>
$1 = void
(gdb) 
</PRE>
<P>
The value <VAR>XXX</VAR> is an unsigned integer as discussed in section 3.
The debugger <CODE>dbx</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX792"></A>
should also work.
<P>
We are in the midst of installing a consistent new way of handling rutime failures into the ILU runtime kernel.  This new way involves the kernel reporting the failure to its caller; the old way involves combinations of panicking, reporting to the user (not the caller) via a printed message, and fragmentary reporting to the caller.  Every time a runtime failure is noted the new way, the procedure <CODE>_ilu_NoteRaise</CODE> in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/error.c'</TT> is called; this procedure thus makes a good place to set a breakpoint when debugging.  Most runtime failures occur due to genuine problems; some occur during normal processing (e.g., end-of-file detection).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC527" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC527">Error handling</A></H2>
<P>
Ideally, the ILU runtime would report all failures
to the application, in the way most appropriate for the application's
programming language.  Sadly, this is not yet the case.
<P>
The ILU runtime kernel has three kinds of runtime failures:
<OL>
<LI>
memory allocation failures from which the kernel cannot proceed;
<LI>
internal consistency check failures, from which the kernel cannot proceed; and
<LI>
internal consistency check failures, which the kernel is prepared to report
to the ILU language-specific runtime veneer (which, hopefully,
would in turn report the failure to the applicaiton).
</OL>
<P>
The second kind is being eliminated.  The first kind is being reduced, and might also be eliminated.
<P>
The application can specify how each of these three kinds of runtime failures is to be handled.  The choices are:
<OL>
<LI>
Print an explanatory message and then explicitly trigger a <CODE>SEGV</CODE> signal by attempting to write to protected memory.  This
is useful for generating core dumps for later study of the error.
<LI>
Print an explanatory message and then exit the program with an application-specified exit code.
<LI>
Print an explanatory message and then enter an endless loop, which calls <CODE>sleep(3)</CODE> repeatedly.  This option is useful
for keeping the process alive but dormant, so that a debugger can attach to it
and examine its "live" state.  This is the default action for all three kinds of failures.
<LI>
Invoke an application-supplied procedure (without printing anything first).
<LI>
Report the failure out of the kernel, without printing anything first (this option is available only for the third kind of failure).
</OL>
<P>
An application can change the action taken on memory failures by
calling <CODE>ilu_SetMemFailureAction</CODE> or <CODE>ilu_SetMemFailureConsumer</CODE>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX793"></A>
<U>[ILU kernel]:</U> void <B>ilu_SetMemFailureAction</B> <I>( int <VAR>mfa</VAR> )</I><P>
<P>
Locking:  unconstrained
<P>
Calling this tells the ILU kernel which drastic action is to be
performed when <CODE>ilu_must_malloc</CODE> fails.  -2 means to print an explanatory message on stderr and then coredump;
-1 means to print an explanatory message on stderr and then loop forever in repeated calls to <CODE>sleep(3)</CODE>; positive numbers mean to print an explanatory message on stderr and then <CODE>exit(<VAR>mfa</VAR>)</CODE>.
The default is -1.  Note that the Python runtime will set this value automatically to the value specified by the environment variable <CODE>ILU_MEMORY_FAILURE_ACTION</CODE>, if it's set.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX794"></A>
<U>[ILU kernel]:</U> typedef void (*) (const char *file, int line) <B>ilu_FailureConsumer</B><P>
A procedure that is called when the ILU kernel can't proceed.  This procedure must not return.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX795"></A>
<U>[ILU kernel]:</U> void <B>ilu_SetMemFailureConsumer</B> <I>( ilu_FailureConsumer <VAR>mfc</VAR> )</I><P>
<P>
Locking:  unconstrained
<P>
An alternative to <CODE>ilu_SetMemFailureAction</CODE>: this causes <VAR>mfc</VAR> to be called when <CODE>ilu_must_malloc fails</CODE>.
<P>
Similarly, an application specifies how unrecoverable runtime consistency check failures are to be handled by calling <CODE>ilu_SetAssertionFailureAction</CODE> or <CODE>ilu_SetAssertionFailConsumer</CODE>, which are exactly analogous to the procedures for memory failure handling.  For recoverable consistency check failures, an application can call <CODE>ilu_SetCheckFailureAction</CODE> or <CODE>ilu_SetCheckFailureConsumer</CODE>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX796"></A>
<U>[ILU kernel]:</U> void <B>ilu_SetCheckFailureAction</B> <I>( int <VAR>cfa</VAR> )</I><P>
<P>
Locking:  unconstrained
<P>
Calling this tells the runtime which action is to be performed
 when an internal consistency check fails.  -3 means to raise an
 error from the kernel (without necessarily printing anything); -2
 means to print an explanatory message to stderr and then
 coredump; -1 means to print and then loop forever; non-negative
 numbers mean to print and then <CODE>exit(<VAR>cfa</VAR>)</CODE>; others number reserved.
 The default is -1.  The Python runtime will set this automatically to the value
of the environment variable <CODE>ILU_CHECK_FAILURE_ACTION</CODE>, if it is set.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX797"></A>
<U>[ILU kernel]:</U> typedef void (*) (const char *file, int line) <B>ilu_CheckFailureConsumer</B><P>
A procedure for handling an internal consistency check failure.
 If this procedure returns, the consistency check failure will be
 raised as an error from the kernel.
 @end deftypevr
<P>
<A NAME="IDX798"></A>
<U>[ILU kernel]:</U> void <B>ilu_SetCheckFailureConsumer</B> <I>( ilu_CheckFailureConsumer <VAR>cfc</VAR> )</I><P>
<P>
Locking:  unconstrained
<P>
An alternative to <CODE>ilu_SetCheckFailureAction</CODE>: this causes <VAR>cfc</VAR> to
 be called (and no printing); if <VAR>cfc</VAR> returns, an error will be
 raised from the kernel.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC528" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC528">Decoding reportable consistency check failures</A></H3>
<P>
For language mappings consistent with CORBA,
the third kind of failure is reported as an occurrence of the CORBA system exception <CODE>internal</CODE>,
with a minor code that encodes the filename and line number where the consistency check occurs.
The coding is this: 10,000*hash(filename, 32771) + linenum + 1,000.
The directory part, if any, is stripped from the filename before hashing.
To aid in decoding these minor codes, ILU includes the program <CODE>decoderr</CODE>, which is used like this:
<PRE>
% decoderr 269211234
269211234 = line 234, file $ILUSRC/runtime/kernel/call.c
</PRE>
<P>
If a reportable consistency check failure occurs in a file not anticipated in the construction of <CODE>decoderr</CODE>, you'll see something like this:
<PRE>
% decoderr 60612345
60612345 = line 1345 in unknown file (that hashes to 6061)
</PRE>
<P>
The program <CODE>iluhashm</CODE> can be used to hash given filenames, so you can search a set of candidates for the mysterious hash code:
<PRE>
% iluhashm 32771 ../cpp/foobar.cpp ../cpp/barfoo.cpp
/* Generated at Mon Dec 11 22:44:47 1995
   with modulus 32771 */
{      6061, "../cpp/foobar.cpp"},
{     13273, "../cpp/barfoo.cpp"},
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC529" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC529">Common Problems - Questions</A></H2>
<P>
Users often run into the same difficulties other users have had.  This section
lists some of these common problems, and describes the possible cures.
<P>
Problem: A server cannot publish an object or a client cannot lookup an object.
<P>
Discussion: When using the shared file approach for simple binding, the
machines on which the client and server programs run must have some shared
filesystem.
<P>
Problem:  It seems that ILU is contacting the wrong server, or if I look at
the SBH's for objects that I know are coming from one source, ILU thinks
they're from someplace else.
<P>
Discussion:  This is usually caused by creating multiple ilu_Server's (e.g. 
in C, the thing you get back from  ILU_C_InitializeServer (...)) that have the
same server ID.  The server ID should be unique.  To understand why,
consider what ILU does when an non-local object reference (an SBH) comes in 
off the wire. ILU looks at the reference and checks to see if it has a surrogate ilu_Server
with that name.  If not, ILU creates one, and (important point) stores away the contact 
information for that ilu_Server. If it already has one with that name, ILU assumes 
that that is the ilu_Server for the object - it doesn't check to see if the contact info 
is different.  Thus, operations directed at objects who are served by that particular
ilu_Server will always be directed at the ilu_Server that ILU saw first. [ILU could
potentially keep track of multiple contact infos, but that still wouldn't help
to disambiguate where operations should be directed.]  This is why in many of the
example programs, you see server ID's being created using some combination of
a fixed string, and a the name of the host the process is running.  Of course, 
if you run multiple instances of the example on the same machine, you would want to 
also incorporate some process or thread information.  You can also simple let ILU
generate a server ID for you, that is unique with a high degree of probability.
<P>
Problem:  My process 'A'  has an object reference to an object 'O' in process 'B'.
Process 'B' exits, and then restarts.  Even though the server name and object 
identifier for 'O' are the same as the first time around, process A is unable to 
perform operations on 'O'.
<P>
Discussion:  The answer here is similar to the answer to the "It seems that ILU is 
contacting the wrong server... " problem.  You're probably letting ILU choose the
server's port number by either letting ILU use it's defaults, or by specifying
a 0 in the port field in the transport specification when creating the ilu_Server.
ILU in process 'A' caches the contact information from the first process 'B'.  When 
process 'B' comes back up, the port number is different.  You can specify what port
should be used in the transport information to prevent this from happening.  For example,
to always come up at port 1234, use "tcp_0_1234".
<P>
Problem:  I'm having problems importing ILU into Python.
<P>
Discussion:  (Where ILUHOME represents where you installed ILU)  
You need to have the ILUHOME/lib directory on your PYTHONPATH
environment variable. Also, ensure that ILUHOME/bin is also on your PATH
environment variable.
<P>
Problem: I'm in Windows, and trying to build some of the examples and I get
complaints that it doesn't know how to make some of the files.
<P>
Discussion:  The Windows make files are not set up to run the language stubbers.  You
must run the stubbers manually before doing the make. e.g. c-stubber Test1.isl
<P>
Problem: I'm on Unix (most probably Digital's), and my program sometimes
exits unexpectedly.
<P>
Discussion: You may be running into a problem where a PIPE signal is
generated and the established action is to exit the program.  In the ILU
source file runtime/kernel/bsdutils.c, the function _ilu_HandleSigPIPE
tries to set up the process to ignore SIGPIPE.  However, it only does this
if the initial SIGPIPE is not SIG_DFL.  (You should see an error message
if _ilu_HandleSigPIPE can't setup to ignore SIGPIPE) On some systems it has
been noticed that even though the application did not explicitly set up a
SIGPIPE handler, the initial SIGPIPE is not SIG_DFL, and the handler that
runs terminates the program.  A workaround to this problem is to either set
the SIGPIPE handler to SIG_DFL yourself before the _ilu_HandleSigPIPE
function runs, or set it to a handler that does nothing with the signal.
