<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC653" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC653">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
The ILU runtime for Common Lisp is largely written
in vanilla Common Lisp.  The lisp-implementation-specific
details are confined to a small number of macros and functions which
need to be defined.  (This assumes that you have a
working port of ILU and its C support already on your operating system
platform.  If not, you will have to begin by doing that.)  
Aside from these macros and functions, you do
not require anything not specified in the Common Lisp standard.  You
do not need Lisp code for TCP/IP or socket support.
The major work is to write ilu-xxx.lisp, where "xxx" is the specifier for the
particular implementation of Common Lisp in use, and any
necessary xxx-to-C shims in ilu-xxx-skin.c.  There are a number of
things that have to be done in ilu-xxx.lisp.  They can be regarded in
three major sections: providing the ILU notion of
foreign-function calls, connecting the Lisp's garbage collector to the
ILU network GC, and providing either a threaded or event-loop
model of operation.  In addition, there is a small hook that has to be
provided to convert between character sets.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC654" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC654">Providing the ILU notion of foreign-function calls.</A></H2>
<P>
Perhaps the trickiest is to provide an implementation of the macro
"define-c-function".  This maps the ILU notion of a call into C into
the native lisp notion.  "define-c-function" has the signature
<P>
<A NAME="IDX883"></A>
<U>Macro:</U> <B>ilu::define-c-function</B> <I>(LISP-NAME <CODE>symbol</CODE>) (DOC-STRING <CODE>string</CODE>) (C-NAME <CODE>string</CODE>) (ARGS <CODE>list</CODE>) (RETURN-TYPE <CODE>keyword</CODE>) &key (INLINE <CODE>boolean</CODE> <CODE>cl:nil</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
The <VAR>LISP-NAME</VAR> is a symbol which will be the name of the function in
Common Lisp.  The <VAR>C-NAME</VAR> is a string which will be the "regular" C name of
the C function to be called; that is, the name as it would be named in
a C program, rather than the name of the symbol for the entry point of
the function.  <VAR>ARGS</VAR> is a list of arg which describe the signature of
the C function, where each arg is either a keyword or a 2-tuple.  If a
keyword, the keyword indicates the type of the argument.  Allowable
argument types are
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>:short-cardinal</CODE> (unsigned-byte 16)
<LI>
<CODE>:cardinal</CODE> (unsigned-byte 32)
<LI>
<CODE>:short-integer</CODE> (signed-byte 16)
<LI>
<CODE>:integer</CODE> (signed-byte 32)
<LI>
<CODE>:short-real</CODE> (single-float)
<LI>
<CODE>:real</CODE> (double-float)
<LI>
<CODE>:byte</CODE> (0 &#60;= fixnum &#60; 256)
<LI>
<CODE>:boolean</CODE> (t or nil)
<LI>
<CODE>:fixnum</CODE> (-2^27 &#60;fixnum &#60; 2^27 (about))
<LI>
<CODE>:string</CODE> (string)
<LI>
<CODE>:constant-string</CODE> (string)
<LI>
<CODE>:bytes (vector of (unsigned-byte 8))</CODE>
<LI>
<CODE>:unicode</CODE> (Unicode if your Lisp supports it, vector of (unsigned-byte 16) otherwise)
<LI>
<CODE>:ilu-call</CODE> (unsigned-byte 32)
<LI>
<CODE>:ilu-object</CODE> (unsigned-byte 32)
<LI>
<CODE>:ilu-class</CODE> (unsigned-byte 32)
<LI>
<CODE>:ilu-server</CODE> (unsigned-byte 32)
<LI>
<CODE>:char*</CODE> (unsigned-byte 32)
<LI>
<CODE>:pointer</CODE> (unsigned-byte 32)
</UL>
If the arg is a 2-tuple, the cadr is
the type, and the car is the "direction", which may be either :in,
<CODE>:out</CODE>, or <CODE>:inout</CODE>.  Args with no "direction" are by default of
direction <CODE>:in</CODE>.  The <VAR>RETURN-TYPE</VAR> argument is a keyword for the return
type of the function, which is drawn from the same set of keywords as
the argument types.  Return-types may also use the keyword :void,
which specifies that no value is returned.  The <VAR>INLINE</VAR> keyword is a
boolean value which, if <CODE>cl:t</CODE>, indicates that the necessary type-checking
has been assured by the application code, and that the C function may
be called directly without type-checking the parameters.
<P>
<CODE>define-c-function</CODE> defines a Common Lisp function with a possibly
different signature from the C function.  This function has arguments
which consist of all the <CODE>:in</CODE> and <CODE>:inout</CODE> arguments of the C function,
in the order in which they occur in the signature of the C function.
It returns possibly multiple values, which consist of the specified
return type, if not <CODE>:void</CODE>, followed by any <CODE>:out</CODE> and <CODE>:inout</CODE> arguments
to the C function, in the order in which they occur in the signature
of the C function.
<P>
<CODE>define-c-function</CODE> assumes that the C function will call back into
Common Lisp, and that gc may occur during the invocation of the C function.
Therefore, any objects passed to C which are not values must be
registered in some way to prevent them from moving during the call.
Often this means that the actual call must be surrounded by code which
makes static copies of, for example, strings, calls the C function,
then frees the static copy after the call.  In addition, when
"catching" <CODE>:out</CODE> arguments and <CODE>:inout</CODE> arguments, it is usually
necessary to pass a pointer to the appropriate argument, rather than
the argument directly.  Typically 1-element arrays have to be
allocated to do this.  The Franz ACL implementation uses a resource of
arrays to minimize consing for this.
<P>
We should probably add another keyword, <VAR>NO-CALLBACKS</VAR>, to indicate that
the C function will not call back into Common Lisp (and therefore some of the
GC protection can be skipped when calling this function).  Providing
for <VAR>NO-CALLBACKS</VAR> in your implementation would probably be a good idea.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC655" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC655">Network Garbage Collection</A></H2>
<P>
The Common Lisp-specific runtime must provide three calls which allow the
kernel to map the kernel's C ILU object to a CLOS object.  These are
register-lisp-object, lookup-registered-lisp-object, and
unregister-lisp-object.  The idea behind these is to provide the C
runtime with a handle on a CLOS object that is a small integer that
will not be moved by Common Lisp GC, and to provide a layer which weak
references can hide behind.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX884"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>ilu::register-lisp-object</B> <I>(OBJ <CODE>ilu:ilu-object</CODE>) &key (REFTYPE <CODE>keyword</CODE> :strong) => <CODE>fixnum</CODE></I><P>
<P>
The OBJ is an ILU CLOS object (the Franz ACL implementation accepts
any Common Lisp value except NIL, but this is only because it uses it
internally in <TT>`ilu-franz.lisp'</TT>).  The <VAR>REFTYPE</VAR> keyword may be either the
keyword <CODE>:weak</CODE> or the keyword <CODE>:strong</CODE>, which determines whether the
reference to the object is a weak reference or a strong reference.  A
weak reference is one that is not "followed" by the Common Lisp collector.
The returned value is a fixnum that can be used with
<CODE>lookup-registered-lisp-object</CODE> and <CODE>unregister-lisp-object</CODE> to find the
object or remove the reference to the object, respectively.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX885"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>ilu::lookup-registered-lisp-object</B> <I>(INDEX <CODE>fixnum</CODE>) => <CODE>ilu:ilu-object</CODE></I><P>
<P>
This function follows the reference indicated by <VAR>INDEX</VAR> and returns the
object, or <CODE>cl:nil</CODE> if the <VAR>INDEX</VAR> is invalid.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX886"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>ilu::unregister-lisp-object</B> <I>(INDEX <CODE>fixnum</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
Causes any reference indicated by <VAR>INDEX</VAR> to be removed.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX887"></A>
<U>Macro:</U> <B>ilu::optional-finalization-hook</B> <I>(OBJ <CODE>ilu:ilu-object</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
This is a macro which should be defined in such a way as to indicate a
finalization action for <VAR>OBJ</VAR> when the Common Lisp collector collects it.  This
finalization action will interact with the ILU kernel to ensure that
remote peers of this Common Lisp will know that it no longer has an interest
in the object.  In addition, the finalization action will be able to
prevent <VAR>OBJ</VAR> from being actually collected, should any peer have an
active reference to it.
<P>
The Franz ACL implementation only allows the
collector to run the finalization when it knows that no peer has a
reference, by keeping the Common Lisp reference to the object as a strong
reference until the C ILU kernel informs the Common Lisp ILU runtime that no
peer has a reference, in which case the Common Lisp reference is changed to a
weak reference.  In time this allows the collector to GC the object,
and the finalization action is called.  The action that needs to be
taken is "null out" both the pointer from the CLOS object to the C
object, via <CODE>(setf (ilu-cached-kernel-obj lisp-obj) nil)</CODE>, and "null
out" the reference from the C object to the CLOS object, via
<CODE>(register-language-specific-object (kernel-obj lisp-obj) 0)</CODE>.  See
<TT>`ilu-franz.lisp'</TT>, <CODE>ilu::franz-shutdown-ilu-object</CODE>, for an example.  The Franz ACL
example also does these shutdowns in a separate thread, instead of
doing them directly in the GC finalization process.  This is because
the shutdown actions may cause arbitrary callbacks into Common Lisp, some of
which may not occur on the stack of the ACL scheduler, which may
invoke the collector.
<P>
If you feel that it just isn't possible to hook your Common Lisp collector
into the network GC, you can simply define <CODE>register-lisp-object</CODE> to
ignore the <VAR>REFTYPE</VAR> parameter, and define <CODE>optional-finalization-hook</CODE>
to expand to nothing.  The result will be that no ILU object in your
address space will ever be GC'ed, and that no true instance of a
collectible ILU object type referenced by your process will ever be
GC'ed anywhere in its true address space until your Common Lisp image
disappears.  This might also be a good starting point, just to get the
other parts working.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC656" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC656">Thread and/or Event Loops</A></H2>
<P>
Every address space into which ILU is loaded is implicitly a server.
This is partially because ILU uses method calls internally, such as
pinging garbage collection callbacks, and partially because it
provides for recursive protocols, in which a "server" might call
back to a "client" during the execution of a method call.  This
means that any implementation of ILU has to provide a way to execute
incoming calls; which means that it has to provide a stack and thread
of control in which to execute the "true" code of the method call.
There are two mechanisms supported by ILU to associate a thread of
control with an incoming request, threads and event loops.  In the
thread model, each request is executed in a thread associated with
either the specific request (thread-per-request) or the connection on
which the thread arrives (thread-per-client).  In the event loop
model, one thread of control is multiplexed between all uses by means
of calls into particular "event handler" routines when some
"event" is delivered to the process.  Typical events are timer
expirations, I/O available on file descriptors, UNIX signals.  Other
more application-specific events are possible, such as X Window System
events or XView toolkit events.
<P>
For a threaded Common Lisp, the thread model is preferred.  To support this,
the implementor of the Common Lisp runtime must call the C procedure
<CODE>ilu_SetWaitTech()</CODE> with two C-callable routines that provide ways to
block the current thread until input or output is available on a
particular file descriptor.  He must call <CODE>ilu_SetMainLoop()</CODE> with a
main loop struct that provides NULL procedures for the <CODE>ml_run</CODE>,
<CODE>ml_exit</CODE>, <CODE>ml_register_input</CODE>, and <CODE>ml_register_output</CODE> fields, simple
procedures that return <CODE>ilu_FALSE</CODE> for the <CODE>ml_unregister_input</CODE> and
<CODE>ml_unregister_output</CODE> fields, and three C-callable procedures that
implement creation, setting, and unsetting of alarms for the
<CODE>ml_create_alarm</CODE>, <CODE>ml_set_alarm</CODE>, and <CODE>ml_unset_alarm</CODE> fields.  Finally, he
must provide C-callable procedures to describe his thread system's
mutex and condition variable system to the ILU C kernel, and register
them by calling <CODE>ilu_SetLockTech()</CODE>.  See the Franz ACL implementation
for an example of this.  Note that the file <TT>`ilu-process.lisp'</TT> provides
an implementation-independent veneer over various process systems.  It
would be useful to extend that, then use it in providing the specific
thread mechanisms, rather than using your Common Lisp's threads directly.
<P>
For an non-threaded Common Lisp, the event loop model is available.  In this,
you divide up all computation in your application into event handlers,
separate functions that are run when some event occurs, and initialize
the system by calling some event handler dispatcher routine, often
called the "main loop" of the system.  ILU provides a default main
loop in the kernel, which provides support for two kinds of events:
timer expiration (ILU calls timers "alarms"), and input or output
available on a UNIX file descriptor.  This means that handler
functions can be registered to be called when an event of one of these
types occurs.  The ILU event loop is also "recursive"; this means
that event handlers can call back into the main loop to wait for
something to occur.  To use the ILU main loop, you must provide mainly
a way to invoke the main loop, probably something like
<CODE>ilu:xxx-main-loop</CODE>, where "xxx" is the name of your flavor of Common Lisp.
<P>
If the ILU main loop is for some reason not satisfactory, a
Common Lisp-runtime-specific main loop can be substituted via a call to the
ILU C kernel routine <CODE>ilu_SetMainLoop()</CODE>.  This is often necessary to
interoperate with UI toolkits like XView or Tk which believe that they
own the main loop.  Note that this main loop must provide all the
functionality provided by the ILU main loop.  A less-powerful main
loop can be used <EM>in addition to</EM> the ILU main loop, by calling the
ILU C kernel routine <CODE>ilu_AddRegisterersToDefault()</CODE>.  See the comments
in <TT>`<VAR>ILUSRC</VAR>/runtime/kernel/iluxport.h'</TT> for documentation of all of this.
<P>
In addition to making the appropriate calls into the ILU kernel to set
up either threaded mode or event-loop mode, the Common Lisp runtime
implementor must provide a few required function calls:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX888"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>ilu::initialize-locking</B><P>
<P>
This misnamed function is called by the generic ILU Common Lisp runtime to
set up the interaction mode, start the scheduler if necessary, and in
general do anything necessary to initialize the Common Lisp-flavor-specific
Common Lisp runtime.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX889"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>ilu::setup-new-connection-handler</B> <I>(FN <CODE>function</CODE>) (SERVER <CODE>C-pointer</CODE>) (PORT <CODE>C-pointer</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
This is called when a client connects to a kernel server, <VAR>SERVER</VAR>,
implemented in this address space.  It should arrange to apply <VAR>FN</VAR> to
<CODE>(list <VAR>SERVER</VAR> <VAR>PORT</VAR>)</CODE> if a new incoming connection is received on <VAR>PORT</VAR>.
<VAR>FN</VAR> should return <CODE>cl:nil</CODE> if no handler could be established, non-<CODE>cl:nil</CODE>
otherwise.  <VAR>SERVER</VAR> is the C address of an ILU kernel <CODE>ilu_Server</CODE>, <VAR>PORT</VAR>
is the C address of an ILU kernel <CODE>ilu_Port</CODE>.  The ILU C kernel routine
<CODE>ilu_FileDescriptorOfMooringOfPort()</CODE> will return the UNIX file
descriptor of the <CODE>ilu_Mooring</CODE> of an <CODE>ilu_Port</CODE>.  In threaded Common Lisps, this
will typically cause a thread to be forked, which will watch for
connections to this port.  In event-loop Common Lisps, this will typically
register <VAR>FN</VAR> as an event handler for "input available on the file
descriptor of the mooring of <VAR>PORT</VAR>".
<P>
<A NAME="IDX890"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>ilu::setup-connection-watcher</B> <I>(FN <CODE>function</CODE>) (CONN <CODE>C-pointer</CODE>) (SERVER <CODE>C-pointer</CODE>)</I><P>
<P>
This is called when a new connection is setup.  It should arrange
things so that <VAR>FN</VAR> is applied to <CODE>(list <VAR>CONN</VAR> <VAR>SERVER</VAR>)</CODE> whenever input is
available on <VAR>CONN</VAR>.  <VAR>FN</VAR> should return non-<CODE>cl:nil</CODE> if the input was
successfully handled, <CODE>cl:nil</CODE> otherwise.  If <VAR>FN</VAR> ever returns <CODE>cl:nil</CODE>, the
connection-watcher should be demolished.  <VAR>CONN</VAR> is the C address of an
ILU kernel <CODE>ilu_Connection</CODE>, and <VAR>SERVER</VAR> is the C address of an ILU
kernel <CODE>ilu_Server</CODE>.  The ILU C kernel routine
<CODE>ilu_FileDescriptorOfConnection()</CODE> will return the UNIX file descriptor
for an <CODE>ilu_Connection</CODE>.  In threaded Common Lisps, this will typically fork a
thread which will handle requests coming in on this connection.  In
event-loop Common Lisps, this will typically register <VAR>FN</VAR> as an event handler
for "input available on the file descriptor of the connection".
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC657" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC657">Converting between character sets.</A></H2>
<P>
<EM>This section is not currently correct, but we are changing the Lisp runtime to make it correct.</EM>
<P>
ILU uses the ISO Latin-1 and Unicode (ISO 10646) character sets.
Common Lisp uses a somewhat different version of `character'.  To
provide for a mapping back and forth between ILU and Common Lisp, the
runtime implementor must provide four macros:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX891"></A>
<U>Macro:</U> <B>ilu::construct-lisp-character-from-unicode</B> <I>(UNICODE <CODE>(unsigned-byte 16)</CODE>)) => <CODE>character</CODE></I><P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX892"></A>
<U>Macro:</U> <B>ilu::determine-unicode-of-character</B> <I>(LISP-CHAR <CODE>character</CODE>) => <CODE>Unicode-code</CODE></I><P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX893"></A>
<U>Macro:</U> <B>ilu::construct-lisp-character-from-latin-1</B> <I>(LATIN-1-CODE <CODE>(unsigned-byte 8)</CODE>) => <CODE>character</CODE></I><P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX894"></A>
<U>Macro:</U> <B>ilu::determine-latin-1-of-character</B> <I>(LISP-CHAR <CODE>character</CODE>) => <CODE>ISO-Latin-1-code</CODE></I><P>
<P>
which I trust are self-explanatory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC658" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC658">Support for Dynamic Object Creation</A></H2>
<P>
ILU allows the dynamic creation of objects.  This means that
a true module can create the true CLOS object for an ILU object in a lazy
manner, when it is referenced.  The mechanism for doing this is
called <I>object tables</I>.  An object table consists of 2 C-callable
functions, one to create an object, given its instance handle, and one to
free any storage associated with the object table.  To support this
mechanism, the Common Lisp port of ILU has to
provide the following function:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX895"></A>
<U>Function:</U> <B>ilu::create-object-table</B> <I>(<VAR>OBJECT-OF-IH-FN</VAR> <CODE>function</CODE>) (<VAR>FREE-SELF-FN</VAR> <CODE>function</CODE>) => <CODE>C-pointer</CODE></I><P>
<P>
The function accepts two Lisp functions, and returns a pointer
to a C struct of type <CODE>ilu_ObjectTable</CODE>, or the value <CODE>0</CODE>,
if no object table pointer can be produced.  The function will have to
call into C space to actually produce the object table.  Look
at the Franz ACL implementation for an example of how to do this.
