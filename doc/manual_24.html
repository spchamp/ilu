<P>
Although it is not required by the specification, most Common Lisp 
implementations include a facility for multiple, independent <I>threads</I> 
of control (often called <I>lightweight processes</I>) within a single Lisp 
environment.  Unfortunately, this facility is not standardized across the 
various implementations.  Although the capabilities provided are very similar 
across implementations, the details of lightweight processes and the interface 
to them differ significantly.  This situation makes it difficult to write 
programs that use lightweight processes and yet are portable across Common 
Lisp implementations. 
<P>
Common Lisp ILU does not requires lightweight processes in 
order to function, but they are useful.  In particular, servers typically make 
heavy use of lightweight process facilities.  The purpose of the 
ILU CL Process Interface is to provide a standardized, portable 
interface to lightweight processes for use within the ILU 
environment.  This interface isolates ILU users from the 
differences in the various lightweight process implementations and allows them 
to write programs that are portable across all implementations to which the 
ILU CL Process Interface has been ported.  At present, these 
implementations include Franz Allegro CL 4.1, and Lucid Common Lisp 3.0 
(a.k.a., Sun Common Lisp).
<P>
This chapter explains how the ILU CL Process Interface works 
for ILU users.  It begins with an overview that describes the 
ILU CL Process model, followed by a listing of some functional 
capabilities of this model.  After brief discussions of the implementation 
architecture and general limitations of the ILU CL Process 
Interface, the chapter presents an example of how to use the interface to 
define a simple shared FIFO queue.  Next, it lists all of the functions and 
macros necessary to use lightweight processes in the ILU 
environment.  The chapter concludes with a brief list of references. 
<P>
To use the information in this chapter, you should be familiar with Common 
Lisp and with the notion of processes and threads in an operating system. 
Familiarity with the UNIX process model would also be helpful.  (See 
the References section for recommendations on further reading.) 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC629" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC629">Overview Of The ILU CL Process Model</A></H2>
<P>
The ILU CL Process Interface features an interface to 
lightweight processes similar to that on the Symbolics Lisp machine.  In 
particular, within a single Lisp environment (which on stock hardware runs as 
a single heavyweight UNIX process) there are multiple threads of control that 
can be scheduled independently.  These threads are called <I>lightweight 
processes</I> (or sometimes just <I>processes</I>).  Each lightweight process 
contains its own run-time control and binding stack, but it shares the global 
data and program address space with all other processes in the Lisp 
environment.  Note that this arrangement differs from that of the UNIX 
heavyweight process facility, where each process has its own address space as 
well as its own run-time stack. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC630" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC630">The Scheduler Process</A></H3>
<P>
Each lightweight process represents an independent thread of control.  The 
multiple threads within the Lisp environment are managed by a special 
<I>scheduler</I> process.  The ILU CL Process Interface 
makes no assumptions about the nature of this scheduler process.  However, 
most implementations use a time-slice, priority-based scheduler.  In such a 
scheduler, an interrupt occurs once every so often (called the scheduler's 
<I>quantum</I>).  When the interrupt occurs, the process that is currently 
running is stopped and its state is saved.  The scheduler then examines all 
processes that are runnable (that is, waiting to run) and restarts the process 
that has the highest priority.  This process runs until the next interrupt or 
until it gives up control to the scheduler, whichever comes first.  At any 
given time, the one process that is "currently" running is known as the 
<I>current process</I>. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC631" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC631">States Of Processes</A></H3>
<P>
In the ILU CL Process model, each lightweight process is 
represented by a single Lisp object that maintains the information about that 
process.  Also, each process is always in one of three states: 
<I>active</I>, <I>inactive</I>, or <I>killed</I>.  A process 
maintains two lists of objects called, respectively, the <I>run reasons</I> 
and the <I>arrest reasons</I> for the process.  For a process to be active, 
it must have at least one run reason and no arrest reasons. A process with no 
run reasons or at least one arrest reason is considered inactive.  The 
ILU CL Process Interface provides functions for adding and 
removing run and arrest reasons for a process. Thus, the user (or a program) 
can move a process between the active and inactive states. 
<P>
The scheduler runs only active processes.  Until an inactive process is 
reactivated, it cannot run.  A killed process is one that has been explicitly 
killed (using the <CODE>ilu-process:process-kill</CODE> function).  A killed 
process can never be run again (that is, it can never be made active). 
<P>
An active process can in turn be in one of two substates: <I>runnable</I> 
and <I>waiting</I>.  A runnable process is ready to be restarted by the 
scheduler, which determines whether and when a process will actually be 
restarted based on its status (that is, priority) and the status of the other 
runnable processes.  A waiting process is a process that has a <I>wait 
function</I> and a list of <I>wait arguments</I>. These two items are supplied 
to the process using the <CODE>ilu-process:process-wait</CODE> function. 
 Periodically, the scheduler will <CODE>apply</CODE> the process's wait 
function to its wait arguments (in the context of the scheduler).  If the 
result is a non-<CODE>nil</CODE> value, the wait function and wait arguments are 
removed from the process, and the process thereby becomes runnable.  Usually, 
the scheduler evaluates the wait functions for all waiting processes every 
time around the scheduler loop.  Therefore, it is important that wait 
functions be fast and very efficient. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC632" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC632">Removing Or Killing Processes</A></H3>
<P>
You can reversably remove a process from a runnable state either by entering a 
wait or by making it inactive.  In general, it is more efficient to make a 
process inactive because this removes it from the scheduler's active process 
list.  Thus, the scheduler does not incur the cost of periodically evaluating 
its wait function.  However, an inactive process cannot make itself active. 
 It must depend on some other process to recognize when it is ready to run 
again and to reactivate it at that time.  Although a waiting process is 
initially more costly than an inactive one, it is automatically returned to a 
runnable state by the scheduler whenever its wait function returns 
non-<CODE>nil</CODE>.  Hence, no second process is needed to <EM>restart</EM> 
a waiting function.  Thus, the choice between waiting a process and rendering 
it inactive depends on the architecture of the application being written. 
<P>
When a process is first started, it is given a Lisp function and a set of 
arguments to this function.  These are known as the process's 
<I>initial-function</I> and <I>inital-arguments</I>, respectively.  A 
newly created process, <CODE>apply</CODE>s its initial-function to its 
inital-arguments.  When the initial-function returns, the process is 
automatically killed.  Once killed it can never be restarted.  You can also 
kill the process before the inital-function returns using the 
<CODE>ilu-process:process-kill</CODE> function, which causes the process to 
execute a <CODE>throw</CODE> in its current context.  This <CODE>throw</CODE> 
causes the stack to unwind (executing unwind-protect forms along the way) and 
the initial-function to return, thereby killing the process. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC633" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC633">Properties Of Processes</A></H3>
<P>
Every process has a number of properties.  Specifically, a process has an 
arbitrary <I>process name</I> that identifies it in displays and in certain 
operations.  Process names need not be unique.  A process also has a 
<I>priority</I> that the scheduler uses optionally to determine when to 
schedule the process.  Priorities are small integers and default to zero (0). 
 In most implementations, processes with higher priorities are given 
scheduling preference.  Negatives are used to indicate that a process should 
run as a background task when nothing else is running.  Finally, a process has 
a <I>quantum</I>, which is the amount of time (measured in seconds) that 
the process wishes to run each time before it is interrupted. In some 
implementations, the scheduler uses a process's quantum to help determine the 
actual length of the time-slice given to the process.  Many implementations 
ignore the quantum altogether. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC634" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC634">Process Locks</A></H3>
<P>
The ILU CL Process Interface also includes a facility called 
<I>process locks</I> that supports exclusion-based sharing of a common 
resource (that is, a common object or data structure) or a critical region of 
code by two or more concurrent processes.  A process lock is an object that a 
process can <I>lock</I> in order to claim exclusive access to the shared 
resource corresponding to the lock.  Process locks are essentially a semaphore 
mechanism specialized for use with the ILU CL Process 
interface. 
<P>
Each process lock has a name and a locker.  A lock's name is for display 
purposes only.  Processes can ask to gain or relinquish exclusive rights to 
the lock (called <I>locking</I> and <I>unlocking</I> the lock, 
respectively).  While a process has rights to the lock, the lock's locker is 
(generally) the process object for that process.  When a process asks to lock 
a lock that is already locked, the asking process blocks and "waits" until 
the lock is free.  Waiting does not necessarily use the standard wait 
mechanism.  Some implementations use process deactivation to implement the 
"wait" in this case.  Some implementations may also maintain a queue of 
processes waiting for a lock to be freed, thereby ensuring fair access to the 
lock.  Other implementations may not maintain such a queue, and therefore fair 
access to the lock is not guaranteed. 
<P>
Process locks are contractual in nature.  The various processes sharing a 
resource (or critical section of code) must all agree not to access the common 
resource while the process lock corresponding to that resource is held by 
another process.  Furthermore, they must agree to lock the process lock 
whenever they need exclusive access to the resource, thereby notifying the 
other processes of their intent. Moreover, the correspondence between a 
process lock and the shared resource is a matter of agreement between the 
cooperating processes. The system does not provide any direct support for this 
correspondence (although it may be added on at a higher level built on top of 
the basic process lock mechanism). 
<P>
Process locks provide a code-centered "sharing" mechanism where the access 
control is built into the programs that access the shared resource.  Process 
locks are suited for closed, or non-extensible, applications where the shared 
resource is a standard Lisp data structure (that is, not a CLOS 
object) and where efficiency is a major concern.  For applications not meeting 
these criteria, a mechanism in which a CLOS object itself 
controls simultaneous access to its internal data structures may be more 
appropriate. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC635" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC635">Functional Overview</A></H2>
<P>
The ILU CL Process Interface provides all of the functions and 
macros necessary to use lightweight processes in the ILU 
environment.  The functionality provided by these functions and macros 
includes:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Starting new processes and killing processes
<P>
<LI>

process, all active processes, or all known processes

<P>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC636" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC636">Implementation Architecture</A></H2>
<P>
The ILU CL Process Interface is implemented as a veneer over 
the existing process interfaces for a number of Common Lisp implementations 
(currently Franz Allegro CL and Lucid Common Lisp).
In many cases, the implementation's functions are simply imported 
and then exported from the <CODE>ilu-process</CODE> package.
In other cases, a new function is wrapped around the 
implementation's native function to change the name, arguments, or semantics 
of the function so that they match those required by the ILU CL 
Process Interface specification.  In a few cases, whole new functions have 
been written to achieve functionality not provided by the original 
implementation. 
<P>
The nature of the process object in the ILU CL Process 
Interface is not specified.  The process object is inherited from the 
underlying implementation and may therefore be a list, a structure, a flavor 
object, or even a CLOS object.  Because of this lack of 
specification, process objects cannot be specialized.  Moreover, they cannot 
be accessed or modified in any way other than through the functional interface 
described in this chapter. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC637" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC637">General Limitations</A></H2>
<P>
The ILU CL Process Interface assumes that the scheduler is 
loaded and running in the ILU environment.  Procedures for 
starting the scheduler are not included in the ILU CL Process 
Interface.  Some implementations, however, may require you to actually load 
and start up the scheduler.  For example, in Franz Allegro CL, you need to 
evaluate <CODE>(mp:start-scheduler)</CODE> either at the top-level or in your 
<TT>`.clinit.cl'</TT> file in order to load and start up the scheduler. 
<P>
The ILU CL Process Interface is subject to all of the 
limitations of its underlying implementations.  In particular, one problem 
with most Common Lisp implementations on stock hardware is that the smallest 
scheduler quantum possible is one second.  This means that each process gets 
to run for one second uninterrupted.  For applications that involve real-time 
response, waiting for one second before an event can be handled is 
problematic.  In practice, this problem can be lessened if all processes 
release control to the scheduler at regular, short intervals (that is, each 
few times around a tight inner loop), thereby making the effective quantum 
significantly less than one second.  Note that this practice effectively 
reduces the scheduler to a prioritized, cooperative scheduler rather than the 
preemptive scheduler intended.
<P>
Most Common Lisp implementations build their process mechanism on top of a 
very powerful mechanism called <I>stack groups</I>.  Stack groups provide 
for alternative run-time stacks in the Lisp environment that can be used for 
various purposes beyond implementing processes.  For example, stack groups are 
an ideal substrate for implementing co-routines. Unfortunately, not all 
implementations provide an interface to stack groups (if indeed they have 
stack groups).  Hence, an interface to stack groups is not a part of the 
ILU CL Process Interface. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC638" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC638">How To Use The ILU CL Process Interface</A></H2>
<P>
The ILU CL Process Interface is intended as a programmer's 
interface; the functions and macros provided should be used to implement 
programs that run in the ILU environment.  Although you can use 
any of the functions and macros directly from a Lisp listener, the interface 
is not designed particularly well for interactive use.  The two exceptions to 
this rule are the functions <CODE>ilu-process:show-process</CODE> and 
<CODE>ilu-process:show-all-processes</CODE>, both of which are designed to 
print out status information in the Lisp listener window.  Because it is a 
user-oriented function, <CODE>ilu-process:show-process</CODE> accepts either 
the process name or a process object to identify the process whose status is 
to be displayed. 
<P>
Most implementations include an interactive interface to multiple processes 
and the scheduler.  For example, Franz Allegro CL has a special top-level 
command language that is operative in every Lisp listener. This command 
language includes the following commands that deal specifically with 
lightweight processes (see Chapter 4 of <CITE>[Franz-92]</CITE> for more 
information):
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:processes</CODE> 
<P>
Lists all processes (see <CODE>ilu-process:all-processes</CODE>)
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:kill</CODE> 
<P>
Kills a process (see <CODE>ilu-process:process-kill</CODE>)
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:arrest</CODE> 
<P>
Adds an arrest reason to a process (see 
<CODE>ilu-process:add-arrest-reason</CODE>)
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:unarrest</CODE> 
<P>
Removes any arrest reason that was added to a process by <CODE>:arrest</CODE> 
(see <CODE>ilu-process:process-revoke-arrest-reason</CODE>)
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:focus</CODE> 
<P>
Performs an <CODE>:arrest</CODE> on a process and arranges for all user keyboard 
input to be sent to the arrested process (usually to the debugger).
<P>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="SEC639" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC639">How To Program The ILU CL Process Interface</A></H2>
<P>
The following example illustrates how to use the ILU CL Process 
Interface to define a shared FIFO queue.  Two processes will utilize this 
queue.  A producer process will read input items from the user and place them 
on the shared queue. A consumer process will wake up every five seconds and 
read items from the shared queue, printing them on the standard output stream 
as they are taken off the queue.  Access to the shared queue will be 
controlled using a process lock associated with the queue.

<LI>
<CODE>:name</CODE> (<CODE>string</CODE>)
<P>
A string to be used as the name of the process.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:priority</CODE> (<CODE>integer</CODE>)

Sets the stack-size of the process (if possible in this implementation).
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:run-reasons</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>)

Sets the run reasons of this process to the given list. Unless run-reasons is 
non-<CODE>nil</CODE>, the forked process does not run until a 
<CODE>ilu-process:process-add-run-reason</CODE> is done.  This property 
defaults to <CODE>(quote (:start))</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>:arrest-reasons</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>)

<H2><A NAME="SEC649" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC649">Handling Errors</A></H2>
<P>
Errors in most of the process functions will cause a break.  There are no 
special tricks to handling these errors.
<P>
The <CODE>:focus</CODE> command is an important tool for using the Allegro CL 
debugger in a multiple-process environment.  In particular, in Allegro CL a 
new process by default shares its standard input/output (I/O) stream with the 
Lisp listener.  Generally, this is not a problem because the process runs in 
the background and does no I/O.  However, if the process enters a break, the 
debugger needs to use the process's standard I/O stream to interact with the 
user.  This could lead to a problem because the debugger I/O from the broken 
process will be interleaved with the Lisp listener's normal I/O. Specifically, 
the system will not be able to determine to which process user input is 
directed. 
<P>
To avoid this situation, Allegro CL has the notion of a <I>focus 
process</I>. Input coming from the shared Lisp listener I/O stream is always sent 
to the focused process.  Usually this is the Lisp listener process.  However, 
if a background process breaks, you can use the <CODE>:focus</CODE> command to 
focus on the broken process and allow you to send input to the debugger 
running in that process.  When the debugging is complete, <CODE>:focus</CODE> is 
automatically returned to the Lisp listener process. 
<P>
The following transcript illustrates the use of the <CODE>:focus</CODE> command 
in Allegro CL: 
<P>
