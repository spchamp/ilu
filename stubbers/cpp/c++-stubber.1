.SH NAME
c++-stubber \- generate ILU stubs for the C++ language
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBc++-stubber\fR \fI[-removefirst]\fR \fIISLFILE\fR [ \fI...ISLFILES\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B c++-stubber
generates the C++ client and server code libraries for the
interface defined in \fIISLFILE\fR, which should be a file
containing an ISL specification of the interface.  If no directory
is specified as part of \fIISLFILE\fR, the stubber will search
for the file in the list of directories specified by the
environment variable \fCILUPATH\fR.  If no file extension is
specified for \fIISLFILE\fR, the extension "\fC.isl\fR" is assumed.
.sp
If the interface being stubbed is called "\fCfoo\fR", three
files called "\fCfoo.H\fR" (which contains the header information for the
classes being defined), "\fCfoo.cc\fR" (which contains the actual library code
for client-side applications), and "\fCfoo-server-stubs.cc\fR" (which contains
additional code for use in servers exporting the interface "\fCfoo\fR"), will
be created.
.sp
If the \fI-removefirst\fR switch is specified, the stubber will attempt
to remove any old versions of the stub files before generating the new
ones.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The environment variable "ILUPATH" is consulted to find referenced
interfaces.  It should consist of a sequence of colon-separated directories,
which contain interface specifications in the form of files
with names like \fI<interface-name>\fC.isl\fR.
