.SH NAME
islscan \- generate pretty-printed form of ISL file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBislscan\fR \fIISLFILE\fR [ \fI...ISLFILES\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B islscan
outputs a report on the interface described in \fIISLFILE\fR
to standard output.  Since it uses the same parser used by
all of the stubbers, it is useful for checking interface files
after they have been written.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
.RS
\fC57 % islscan foo.isl
.br
Interface "foo" (v1), imports "ilu"     {defined on line 1}

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The environment variable "ILUPATH" is consulted to find referenced
interfaces.  It should consist of a sequence of colon-separated directories,
which contain interface specifications in the form of files
with names like \fI<interface-name>\fC.isl\fR.
